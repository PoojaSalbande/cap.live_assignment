1. Installing Required Libraries
		You installed multiple Python libraries:

Data processing and analysis: pandas, numpy.
Web scraping: beautifulsoup4, scrapy, selenium, praw.
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, tensorflow, torch.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): transformers, nltk, textblob.
Stock market data: yfinance.
2. Web Scraping with praw
You used the Reddit API (praw) to scrape data from subreddits like stocks and wallstreetbets.

Purpose: Gather text data (titles, body, and comments) about stock discussions.
Key Steps:
Authentication: Provided client_id, client_secret, and user_agent for Reddit API access.

Scraping:

Fetched top 100 posts from the "hot" section of each subreddit.
Extracted:
Post title.
Post body.
Comments.
Upvote/downvote score.
Post creation time (UTC).
Data Storage: Stored the extracted data into a list of dictionaries (data).

3. Cleaning and Saving Data
You cleaned and saved the scraped data for analysis.

Steps:
Text Cleaning:

Removed links, special characters, and converted text to lowercase using re.
Applied cleaning to both post body and comments.
Save to CSV:

Saved the raw and cleaned data into CSV files (reddit_stock_data.csv and cleaned_reddit_stock_data.csv).
4. Preprocessing with nltk
You used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the text further.

Steps:
Stopword Removal: Used NLTK's stopword list to filter out common words like "the," "is," etc., which do not contribute to meaning.

Tokenization: Split the text into individual words (tokens) and retained only meaningful words (alphanumeric).

Column Addition: Added a preprocessed_body column to store the cleaned and tokenized post body.

Save: Saved the preprocessed data to a CSV file (preprocessed_reddit_stock_data.csv).

5. Sentiment Analysis
You analyzed the sentiment of the posts using TextBlob.

Steps:
Calculated the polarity score (ranging from -1 to 1):

Positive sentiment: Score > 0.
Negative sentiment: Score < 0.
Neutral sentiment: Score = 0.
Added a sentiment column to store these scores.

6. Stock Market Data with yfinance
You fetched stock price data using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).

Steps:
Retrieved stock data for Apple (AAPL) between January and November 2024.
Added a Movement column:
1 if the next day's closing price is higher than the current day's.
0 otherwise.
7. Stock Mentions in Reddit Posts
You analyzed how often specific stock symbols (e.g., AAPL) were mentioned in Reddit posts.

Steps:
Counted the occurrences of each stock symbol in the preprocessed_body column.
Added new columns for each stock (e.g., mention_AAPL) with their mention counts.
8. Machine Learning: Predict Stock Movement
You applied machine learning to predict stock price movement based on Reddit data.

Steps:
Feature Selection:

Features: sentiment, stock mention columns (e.g., mention_AAPL).
Target: Stock movement (Movement).
Train-Test Split:

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.
Model Training:

Used a Random Forest Classifier to train on the feature-target data.
Prediction:

Predicted stock movement on the test set.
Evaluation:

Calculated accuracy and displayed a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
Generated a confusion matrix to evaluate prediction performance.
9. Summary of Outputs
CSV Files:

reddit_stock_data.csv: Raw scraped Reddit data.
cleaned_reddit_stock_data.csv: Cleaned Reddit data.
preprocessed_reddit_stock_data.csv: Tokenized and preprocessed Reddit data.
Sentiment Analysis:

sentiment column shows polarity scores for posts.
Stock Mention Counts:

Columns with the frequency of stock mentions.
Machine Learning Results:

Accuracy: How well the model predicted stock movement.
Classification Report: Breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-scores.
Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
