"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 15, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

They filed for bankruptcy back in mid July. I‚Äôm here to tell you why Sunnova is next. \nI‚Äôve worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years. Sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealers/installers all year. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sunnova is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. Search Reddit/facebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and it‚Äôs a pretty open secret. \n\n‚ÄúNOVA holds approximately $7.98 billion in total debt. This represents a 25.33% increase over the past year, contributing to a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.58, which is significantly above industry norms‚Äù\n\nThey currently sit at a $485 million market cap, eerily similar to Sunpower before they went under. It is only a matter of time for Sunnova. Most dealers/installers are moving all of their volume away from using them as they‚Äôve been late on payments. Instead of the reps getting paid upon install, they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated. Sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing. The last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new Sunnova PPAs/loans. \n\nSunnova holds an INSANE amount of debt. I honestly have no idea how they are still afloat. I didn‚Äôt think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year. Their free cash flow is in the toilet.\n\n‚ÄúSunnova Energy International (NOVA) reported a negative free cash flow (FCF) of approximately -$2.13 billion over the trailing 12 months. This figure is derived from an operating cash flow of -$282.75 million and capital expenditures totaling -$1.85 billion. The significant cash burn highlights the company‚Äôs capital-intensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations‚Äù\n\nI know what you‚Äôre thinking, their stock is already down massively since the election. Yes, that was based on all solar stocks dropping. Sunrun (which I believe will be around for the long haul) also dropped like a rock. However I believe within 6 months Sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0. \nI don‚Äôt think trump will kill the solar tax credit. However it wont matter for Sunnova. Their CEO is a former Enron exec. This company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat. Has worked for far longer than it should have. Their partnership with Home Depot has largely been a dud. Nothing like Sunruns partnership with Costco. \n\nUnless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1% in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts. \n\nPOSITIONS:\nNOVA 1/17/25 $2.5 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $1 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $2 PUT\nNOVA 4/17/25 $3 PUT', 'Is it smart to dump 10k into VOO at these levels?

I bought 3000 shares with a cost basis of $0.40.\n\nOver the weekend, I happened to see a thread where people were discussing how BlueSky is booming and TwiXter is cratering, and someone posted a derisive cautionary note that Bluesky Digital Assets Corp (BTCWF) was unrelated to BlueSky the social network.

I think this means Peabody will pay $450M extra if Grosvenor successfully re-opens. Peabody has been hoarding a huge amount of cash so they can definitely afford it but taking on some debt. Total deal is up to $3.75B, with $2.05B up front. There is contingent payments of $500M and another $750M but those are tied to met coal prices reaching certain levels. In other words, if met coal prices end up sucking, BTU pays a cheaper price for the met coal assets.\n\nShort-term this is probably bad for shareholders (though the stock isn\'t violently reacting downwards like I might have expected). Definitely a disappointment for the \'get on with the buybacks\' crowd. Long term this is a good step toward shifting away from thermal coal and focusing fully on met, which has a strong future for another 20-30 years. The life of their assets have now increased substantially and they have practically 2x/3xed their met coal production non-organically.\n\nI wish this company wasn\'t stuck with its low margin Powder River Basin thermal coal, which it mines in massive quantities. I\'m mostly neutral on this move, maybe a little annoyed, and a bit worried about the debt. But I think the contingent nature of the costs is a big plus. If met coal prices suck for 2 years then they end up paying $2B instead of $3-4B. And Grosvenor is basically for \'free\' unless it starts producing again.\n\nEDIT: BTU (well Twitter commentary regarding press release) adds: ""Capital returns policy is expected to continue as consideration payments will be from acquired assets, ie, assets are self-financing.""

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state‚Äôs Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor‚Äôs proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian‚Äôs next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company‚Äôs domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company‚Äôs midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company‚Äôs long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity‚Äìsupporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company‚Äôs future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region‚Äôs significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour‚Äôs drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE‚Äôs intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

Why MicroStrategy Stock Rocketed 24.7% Higher This Week,"MicroStrategy has been the talk of YouTube lately with most posters being very bullish.  This article presents a slightly bearish case.

# Article Summary:

* Stock Surge: MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock rose by 24.7% this week, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs price increase and a new convertible debt offering.
* Bitcoin Holdings: The company now holds 279,420 Bitcoins, benefiting from Bitcoin‚Äôs 10% price rise this week.
* Convertible Debt: MicroStrategy issued a $3 billion convertible note with a 0% interest rate, due in 2029, allowing them to buy more Bitcoin1.
* Investment Advice: Despite the attractive financing, the article suggests that buying MicroStrategy stock at its current high valuation may not be wise for long-term investors.","[""That's what leverage does. Wait for the elevator down."", 'I can‚Äôt wait to see the loss porn soon lol', 'Mania. Not unheard of in the stock market.', ""I'm in the UK, and many banks have made it very difficult to buy Bitcoin by blocking transactions with Bitcoin vendors. Profits from Bitcoin have also been heavily taxed. Buying MicroStrategy lets retail get exposure to Bitcoin without much hassle and, more importantly, buy it on ISA. Anyone can open an ISA and load it up with shares worth up to ¬£20k a year. With ISA, you don't pay tax on any dividends from shares, and you don't pay capital gains tax on any profits made from the investments.\n\nSo MicroStrategy, to many, feels like a way to rip off short-term, tax-free profit if BTC goes up during this cycle."", 'There is a deep confusion everywhere online about this stock at the moment.\n\n**Is MSTR is Levered Bitcoin?**\n\nEmphatically, no it is not. Not since several years ago. It has (approximate numbers) a 100B market cap and has 33B of BTC. It trades at a 3x premium to its NAV. That is the opposite of ""Levered BTC"". For every $1 of MSTR you buy, your BTC exposure is literally $0.33. You don\'t get more than $1 of exposure, you get significantly less.\n\n**Why is it moving like levered BTC then?**\n\nMSTR\'s moves are a truly astonishing phenomenon in our markets today, up there in the annals of history with stock movements such as GME in Jan 2021. There are a number of reasons why it is moving like this, including:\n\n * **(1)** Catalysts, such as the MSTR BTC yield, Saylor\'s big BTC buys, and Trump winning, put MSTR on a lot of people\'s radar, and the buying started. \n * **(2)** Leveraged funds such as MSTX and MSTU own over 10B of exposure MSTR, and have to buy a lot on up days, and they contribute to the runaway rally. If MSTR is up 10% on the day, these two funds together will have to buy 1B of MSTR, which is 1% of the company. Note that most stocks don\'t even have 1% of their shares trade in a day.\n * **(3)** Various short sellers and call sellers have been hurt by certain initial moves, and have had to close, pushing the rally even further. See for example the r/thetagang guy.\n * **(4)** Various hedge funds were short MSTR and long BTC because it was trading at a premium of 1.5x NAV, and that premium kept increasing, causing people to have to close their books at a massive loss.\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, please add any other reasons you can think of below.\n\n\nThe magnitude of the MSTR moves, and the current premium it trades at, are truly an astonishing market phenomenon.', 'I am having a very hard time following the bullish case since the market value of MicroStrategy is currently three times the market value of the bitcoin it owns.  No amount of saying its levered so its ok, changes this basic fact.  What happens if the value of bitcoin takes a big tumble?  Will the leverage that supposedly justifies the inflated value of MicroStrategy work to deflate it on a bitcoin price break?  Seems very risky.', 'It holds so much BTC that if US takes the position to add a reserve of BTC, it will skyrocket like a vicious cycle. It‚Äôs just leveraged BTC. The unique thing about the stock is that it is actively using financial tools to serve its own value. It‚Äôs a bet on BTC pretty much. But MSTR is only accumulative for BTC, they aren‚Äôt selling any of their holdings. They aren‚Äôt actively trading BTC back and forth, just absorbing more. They buy whether BTC is flat, lowering, raising in value. \n\nMost people that invest in it are anticipating that BTC will be more valuable than it is today. It‚Äôs overweight today but MSTR is still buying more BTC (secretly behind the scenes) by the time it gets announced publically, the price is sometimes locked in at a average cost of $10-15k per btc cheaper. \n\nI‚Äôm not really invested in it but it seems like it‚Äôs like investing in a conveyer belt of BTC rather than just a sterile flat static purchase of btc.\n\nThe key question is how does MSTR differ from a BTC ETF, and the answer to its value will be there.', ""At some point, retail buyers will run out of money.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome¬†and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.



||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||
|Settlement|Make it all go away!||

However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

They also said MDA‚Äôs satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline**¬†of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.","['Just to add, alcohol and weed have this is common : regular users make up like 95% of their sale. Who cares about you who put 1 drop and get high, they care about users who go through an oz in less than a week because their tolerance is off the roof, they care about 40oz of vodka being sold every week to the same dude, not the guy who buys only one per year for christmas.', 'What you are overlooking here is the rapid and extreme development of tolerance in cannabis. A part time user (say 1-3 times a month) will never raise their dose of edible above say 5-15 milligrams creating the high strength product low consumer demand situation you describe. However. If you use more than once per week your tolerance goes up very quickly in ways it does not go with alcohol. A 1-2x per week use can bring their tolerance up to 100mg per dose pretty easily and all of the sudden you need an entire chocolate bar for one ""session"". The cannabis market is dominated and driven by habitual users not casual ones and the product strength is in response to their needs, not the casual user for whom these high strength products make cannabis virtually free. And generally there aren\'t the same over negative consequences to habitual use as there is with alcohol and a converted habitual use can be a solid customer for decades as opposed to alcoholics who go down a cheaper product spiral or illegal drug users who\'s use can be captured as customer revenue', '\\>I never smoked much anyway,\n\n  \nthere you go, the weed at this point is reaching a limit at or around 37%. Habitual users smoke the same amount of weed because their tolerance goes up brahh', ""When any new market opens, it is always flooded with multiple businesses trying to win market share. Eventually a large portion of these businesses will die out or be bought out by a big player. After the market has consolidated, prices will creep up. Also, your assumption about not needing as much is only true in your scenario. Personally, I will smoke flower all day. I enjoy the act of smoking, but I hate the taste of tobacco. So in my scenario, I will keep buying at fairly regular intervals. Also, the assumption that there isn't a social aspect to it is just wrong. Smoking by yourself is boring.

Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS‚Ä¶

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times‚Ä¶

Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"A few months ago I posted about Games Workshop and why I thought it was undervalued.  
TLDR: the new Space Marine II game was a hit and this would drive increased sales.

In the end, I decided to hold (thank God!)

Today GW announced significantly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, resulting in a 15% bump in stock price.

My hope is that this also makes an Amazon show deal more likely. This is clearly a popular and valuable IP and hopefully, this news will help get a deal over the line with Amazon.

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.  (And yes, I realize I should have been using trailing stops, but didn't, so no lectures there, please.)","["">I always assume short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term. \n\n2021 to 2024 is not long-term.

AMD: The $145 Recovery Rally is Coming Next Week,"**The Why**

* **Earnings beat** revenue expectations with $6.82B (+18% YoY) and EPS of .92 (+31% YoY and spot on with projection) 
* Data center revenue surged **+122%**, proving AMD is gaining AI momentum.
* Recent selloff (-$30/share) was a **market overreaction** to slightly soft Q4 guidance.
* The market shifted focus to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings stalling an AMD rally.
* **Catalysts**: Workforce optimization, IBM partnership, and AI-focused leadership changes.

# The Setup

AMD is streamlining its org for an **AI-dominated future**:

1. **Reduction in Force**: Cutting 4% of workforce to focus on AI chip development.
2. **New Leadership**: CFO transition positions AMD for its next growth phase.
3. **IBM Partnership**: MI300X accelerators are now a key piece of IBM Cloud‚Äôs AI stack.

By losing very little principal during drawdowns, it avoids the ""[volatility tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax)"" that crushes your long-term CAGR. In its original 1999 incarnation, the portfolio was divided according to this rubric:\n\n* 25% equities (can be represented by SPY)\n* 25% long-term bonds (can be represented by TLT)\n* 25% gold (can be represented by GLD)\n* 25% cash (can be represented by SHY or a savings account)\n\nRay Dalio\'s twist on it during the 2000s was to apply external leverage to juice returns. The original\'s Sharpe ratio was 0.6 and Dalio pushed it back up to 1, accruing better ROI with the same volatility as SPY. Recently Porter Stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities. The actual details behind his version are too long for this post, but the idea of internal leverage^1 to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind. \n\nFor the last six months I\'ve been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown. The key word here is *converted*: I was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with non-linear returns on short notice. During period of crisis for the bond market, long-term securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up. In such instances you are stuck with a ""risk free"" asset that\'s rapidly depreciating in value. Simultaneously I wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the Sharpe ratio - it forces your CAGR to converge with the general market during good times. We want a setup that outperforms when the market\'s hot and offers better principal protection when it\'s cold. \n\nAfter doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of May, I arrived at the following portfolio:\n\n* 30% equities, replacing SPY with high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria.\n* 30% gold and other precious/industrial metals, leveraged through exposure to high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria. \n* 20% income option strategies. They are characterized by a high win rate (ideally 75% and above), high profit factors, uniform application across equities, and a focus on frontrunning institutional moves based on taking advantage of *their* long-term strategies for generating wealth. We would use the Kelly Criterion to determine allocation and guard against disproportionate losses. These replace bonds entirely. \n* 20% cash, preferably in a MMF or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation. \n\nThe big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options. It probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative, but that\'s due to retail primarily using options for speculation. They don\'t employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk. Yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow.^2 All of them are based on exploiting how money flows through the structure of the market, not whether an individual stock/ETF will directionally move in our favor. The tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return, and the risk can be ameliorated.  \n\nThe arguments in favor of options over bonds are the following: \n\n* In theory, you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless. In reality, it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital. Unless you\'re running a 0DTE, you should never lose more than 25-30% before hitting the stop loss. \n* Since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions, they are agnostic to the state of the market. It doesn\'t matter if it is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways period. By contrast bonds rely on a disinflationary/deflationary environment to appreciate in value. In inflationary environments, bonds are doubly penalized: you lose on real yield returns and the underlying value is crushed as rates are hiked.\n* As these income option contracts are primarily short duration, the cash from premiums + returns can be invested into longer-dated puts during market corrections. At the bottom of bear markets, the cash flow can be diverted into equities.\n* Repeatable options strategies are not that rare. For example, there is a multi-leg setup that has a historical win rate of 90% with an average 20% return per winning transaction and a 17:1 profit factor. When we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week, you will generate roughly 600% return on that investment over 40 weeks. The general loss when it fails is 5-10% with an occasional dip below 20%. There are strategies based on gamma exposure, anchored VWAP on stocks with strong upwards/downward momentum, 0DTE credit spreads, selling contracts on blue-chips during periods of momentary weakness, etc. that succeed 80-95% of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters. The biggest obstacle to success is maintaining the discipline to avoid exposure to big losses. \n* As a corollary to 3 and 4, the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low Sharpe ratio. The returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis, which gives you the flexibility to rebalance portfolio distribution based on the state of the market. \n* The majority of principal dedicated to options is never in play at any particular point. It is technically cash until it\'s tied up into contracts - the wagered amount is sized according to the Kelly Criterion. In practice you\'ll have 35-40% of the portfolio in cash. While the inherent risk is higher for options than bonds, the overall risk to the portfolio is lower in the face of secular economic changes.\n\nThis is not a gameplan for passive investors. It requires a moderate amount of oversight. \n\n^1 The difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns. External leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt. This debt is independent of the investment\'s mechanics, such as a margin account. Internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset, treating the security as a second order derivative. Think of junior miners that go up 500%, 1000%, 5000% during a gold bull market. The key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility, using a combination of allocation size and selecting capital-efficient proxies with good management. Leveraged ETFs are not considered.\n\n^2 Bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable, predictable behavior from the former. In the case of the U.S. government, the holder assumes the government is both solvent and willing to fulfill their obligations. Guess what that also describes? An options contract. The difference is you, as a holder, are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control 80-85% of all transaction volume. In the aggregate they exhibit formulaic actions when rebalancing their portfolios, protecting their downside, and so on that is easily exploitable. It\'s this feature, not a promise to pay interest, that generates long-term cash flow.', 'Lots of these comments read like late 2021.', 'Citadel buys (a lot of) Intel stock, trims (a lot of) NVDA.\xa0\n\n\nCrazy? ü§£', 'As unhappy I am with the CROX acquisition of Hey Dude and how much of a drag it has been on the business, it is worth keeping in context that the business is otherwise cruising ahead.

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.","['So from $48 to $500.

Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then? 

What would you do in my situation?","[""You can't know for certain that there will be a significant correction, or that you would time your exit & re-entry well enough to take advantage of it.

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can‚Äôt reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

What do you think? How is this influencing your investment decisions?","[""You missed out the fact that generative AI is essentially a logarithmic function as well. That means exponential increases in model size are needed for incremental improvements in functionality, rapidly approaching a limit.\n\nThe alternative models are all pretty theoretical at the moment AFAIK\n\nIt's not influenced my investing decisions at all though."", 'Yes, very few AI companies are actually turning a profit, except the ones that are selling shovels to other AI companies.\n\nThe big thing to look out for is increased capex, and therefore depreciation at large tech companies. This will lead to slowing earnings growth, which in turn can hurt valuations. But due to the nature of accounting, it will take time to show up', ""I think you might be overestimating the importance of these drawbacks.\n\n>Factually unreliable outputs (it can‚Äôt reliably distinguish fact from fiction)\n\nThis can be greatly improved with RAG and instituting some degree of redundant QA or human in the loops for mission critical applications.

C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Their manufacturing facility will be completed in weeks.

This is not some vaporware - they have real manufacturing power. The company will pump out 650 aircraft yearly. That translates to billions in revenue when each Midnight sells for $5M+.

Regarding FAA certification, they have [already nailed Phase 3 of 4](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-announces-third-quarter-2024-210500611.html).

DOJ calls for Google to divest Chrome in antitrust push,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is pushing for¬†[significant changes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-doj-wants-to-break-up-google-it-needs-to-convince-a-judge-first-090007934.html)¬†to Google ([GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/),¬†[GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/)), including a divestment of its Chrome browser, following an August court ruling that found the company had illegally monopolized the search market.

Yahoo Finance‚Äôs Senior Legal Reporter¬†[Alexis Keenan](https://www.yahoo.com/author/alexis-keenan/)¬†joins Morning Brief Co-hosts¬†[Brad Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/)¬†and¬†[Seana Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/)¬†to discuss what this means for Google and its parent company, Alphabet.  
  
Keenan notes that while Google has opposed the DOJ‚Äôs proposals, calling them a ‚Äúradical agenda‚Äù that could harm consumers and the tech industry, the case becomes more complicated with the upcoming administration change.

In my opinion, GOOGL shares are extremely undervalued, and this situation will resolve itself once Trump takes control.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts‚Äô estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here‚Äôs how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won‚Äôt have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit‚Äôs global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

‚ÄúWe are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,‚Äù Sandeep Aujla, Intuit‚Äôs finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. ‚ÄúWe are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.‚Äù

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount‚Äôs $430 million consensus.

At Thursday‚Äôs close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposed ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äù had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is ‚Äúalready available to all Americans,‚Äù CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC‚Äôs Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he‚Äôs personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

‚ÄúOur belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.‚Äù

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I‚Äôll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there‚Äôs no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The¬†**Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as ‚ÄúGMV‚Äù, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use¬†**Gross Merchandise Sales**¬†(‚ÄúGMS‚Äú), which is just a different term.
* The¬†**take-rate**¬†represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson:¬†***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that¬†***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn‚Äôt (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy‚Äôs revenue a decade ago. Now, it‚Äôs down to \~50%.

I‚Äôll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue**¬†(\~73% of total) - These are¬†**required**¬†fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue**¬†(\~27% of total) - These are¬†**optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay‚Äôs take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb**¬†(Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for¬†**$270 million**.
* **Elo 7**¬†(July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the ‚ÄúEtsy of Brazil‚Äù, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for¬†**$212 million**.
* **Depop**¬†(July 12th, 2021)¬†- a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of¬†**$70 million!**¬†No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of¬†**over $1 billion**¬†for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders‚Äô value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers‚Äô base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue**¬†\- Given that the number of active buyers hasn‚Äôt grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin**¬†\- I do think there‚Äôs room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is¬†**$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of¬†**$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‚Äòstrong start‚Äô to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at¬†Gap¬†during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year.¬†

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of ‚Äúup slightly.‚Äù That‚Äôs ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway.¬†

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the nation‚Äôs largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap‚Äôs reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.¬†

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap‚Äôs business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview.¬†

‚ÄúWe had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,‚Äù said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap‚Äôs largest brand by revenue, the most.¬†

As soon as the weather turned around, sales ‚Äúrebounded‚Äù and the holiday shopping season is off to a ‚Äústrong start‚Äù so far, said Dickson.¬†

‚ÄúWe are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got stronger brand identities and we‚Äôre more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.‚Äù¬†

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he‚Äôs worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it¬†needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here‚Äôs a closer look at each brand‚Äôs performance:¬†

**Old Navy:**¬†Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy‚Äôs kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson.¬†

**Gap:**¬†Gap‚Äôs eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% ‚Äî better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said.¬†

**Banana Republic:**¬†The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men‚Äôs business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused ‚Äúon fixing the fundamentals,‚Äù the company said.¬†

**Athleta:**¬†The athleisure arm of Gap‚Äôs empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren‚Äôt comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

","['""Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past""\n\nThere\'s been plenty of companies targeted by shorts in the past that went to 0. Most of the Lampert era of Sears was a long vs short saga that lasted over a decade - it eventually was largely Lampert and former ""Morningstar Manager of the Decade"" Berkowitz on one side and the shorts on the other. There were tremendous short squeezes at times in Sears all the way down, but the closer it go to 0 the shorter they lasted. There were people posting at $2 that ""Eddie Lampert is a billionaire, he has a plan!"" Yes, he did - a plan for himself loaning the company money against the company\'s best real estate - heads I win, tails I win. It went from Business Week covers talking about how Lampert was going to create his Berkshire Hathway to eventual bankruptcy.\n\nI think that we\'re in an odd period where things have turned into memes or recovered in a fashion that would otherwise be unusual in the past. AMC has been able to dilute shareholders incessantly. If this was several years ago, it probably would have been a 0 already rather than the meme boost and the constant equity raises after that have been tolerated. Yellow went bankrupt then went up 600% before cratering. There are people who still think that Bed Bath and Beyond\'s bankruptcy is a massive conspiracy. SAVEQ seems to be the latest in the line of these - Gamestop\'s short squeeze seems to have taught a generation of investors that ""bad is not bad"", every poorly run company/mediocre business is a potential meme/short squeeze and anyone who has a different opinion is somehow conspiring against them. \n\nIn investing sometimes people are going to have differing opinions than you about your investments. Sometimes those people are going to have bigger platforms to broadcast their views. Sometimes those people are going to be right. Sometimes those people aren\'t right but maybe you read what they have to say and they make some good points - they aren\'t ultimately right but some of it makes you think and see your investment perhaps in ways you previously haven\'t. If you read what they have to say and still think you\'re right, you thank them for the opportunity and buy lower.\n\nInvesting is a life long learning experience and imo, people should be open to maybe learning from people who don\'t share the same opinion. \n\nIt\'s really only the last 5 years that any time there\'s a short discussion people run and post about ""MANIPULATION!!!"" Meanwhile, what would those people say if they were short the stock and the report was someone who was long? People have less ire towards pump and dump scams (hot quantum computing stock QUBT was ""Innovative Beverage Company"" not that long ago - keep in mind Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain wasn\'t that many years ago) than they do towards someone who has a negative opinion on a popular retail long.  It\'s the Simpsons meme: ""Could I be wrong?"" ""No, it must be a short seller conspiracy.""\n\nNot everyone is going to share your opinion on your investments and be open to the idea that maybe they can make an interesting point you hadn\'t considered or be right. People rant about how any sort of short anything is ""manipulation"" but we\'re in a time period where people seem far less tolerant in investing to any opinion that isn\'t theirs. There was a time where Reddit wasn\'t full of little echo chamber stock-specific subreddits where people go to hear everyone agree with them and people could have differing opinions on here and it actually sometimes lead to good discussions rather than just insta-downvotes and/or being scolded for not agreeing with a prevailing trend/opinion on something.\n\n If you read what they have to say and still disagree, thank them for the opportunity and buy more - that\'s it. If you have to post to confirm whether to invest or not, maybe you\'re not as confident in the business as you need to be.', 'I own the stock. The Culper report was bogus. Their previous short reports were SOUN, IREN, GCT, XMTR, AXSM, TBBK, RUM, KSPI, XPEL, and ACEO. Most of these have been just fine. \n\nHappy to keep holding ZETA.', 'What does zeta do?', 'Huh.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) ‚Äì potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013. ¬†This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm ‚Äì he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn‚Äôt in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club‚Äôs shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is ‚Äì if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is ‚Äì there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.","['The club has been one of the worst managed in Europe for over a decade.

I walk into sport shops now in Ireland and Man City jersies are on sale, and you dont see Utd jersies anymore, especially amongst the children.\n\n\nThere is also going to be a redevelopment of their ground and they'll have to deploy capital there instead of signings in the medium term."", ""Oh we're really just throwing crap at the wall and hoping it sticks now."", 'Not one single mention of anything financial related.', ""The club is still valued in the billions and have a rabid fan base even tho they have been terrible in recent years.

You have a stock that went public 12 years ago and is up 25%. Anyone who\'s a fan probably enjoys owning a piece of the team but it\'s not been a very good investment. If the team gets better the stock might be somewhat better going forward, but I still think you are going to be able to find better investments elsewhere than an improved MANU. I just don\'t think that there\'s much interest in public sports teams unless people think that there\'s some chance of buyout.', 'Only own it if your a  supporter.  Period.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*¬† ¬†

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.*¬†

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.","['I\nIt was a good Q, don‚Äôt understand the problem.

Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India‚Äôs Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman¬†Gautam Adani¬†was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in¬†an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group‚Äôs flagship firm¬†Adani Enterprises¬†fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm¬†Adani Green Energy¬†tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%.¬†

Adani Power¬†lost 13.81%,¬†Adani Port‚Äôs share price dropped 10%, while the group‚Äôs retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark¬†NSE Nifty 50¬†Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited ‚Äî his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain ‚Äî have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company‚Äôs adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec ‚Äî Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. ‚ÄúThose employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,‚Äù the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and ‚Äúbrazen stock manipulation‚Äù made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research.¬†

‚ÄúSince releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,‚Äù Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has ‚Äúalways been in compliance with all laws.‚Äù

These charges do not change the ‚Äústrong underlying fundamentals‚Äù of India‚Äôs market or the country‚Äôs growth trajectory, said Raymond James‚Äô head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton.¬†

‚ÄúOnce the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,‚Äù he said.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets.¬†

There‚Äôs an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight.¬†

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I‚Äôve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022).¬†

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I‚Äôm considering:¬†

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold¬†

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

What is your opinion? Have there been any misdirection from ASML or is this frivolous? Even so, could this affect the stock price in the near term?","['These lawsuits are made by the most dubious small law firms. You will see them everywhere and they never amount to anything.

The Bronstein lawsuit is just a harassment with a purpose to extract some money in a settlement.\n\nHowever, there is a high threshold to prove that the statements were false and misleading: the statements are usually prepared by external accounting / business analysis companies and approved by a corporate counsel. It is exceedingly rare that the CEO would overwrite those with own, materially false claims.

What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn‚Äôt this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn‚Äôt everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

I know I am misunderstanding something I just don‚Äôt know what. Any clarification would be appreciated. ","[""Dividend stocks in general don't grow as quick as others because they pay out capital they could be using to expand their business.  A great dividend stock will usually go up very slowly.  \n\nSo if you invest 100,000 in a dividend stock you might get the 7% high yield divi but if you invested the same in a tech stock it might have grown 25% in the same year.  So really you lost potential earning.\n\nISPY is very different and risky.  It gets the very high yield from daily covered calls.  So your losses could be much more if the market goes down.  They don't have a long track history to see what it would do in a bear market.  I would be very careful investing long term in ISPY"", 'Two things to consider with dividend stocks:\n\n1. You pay taxes on those dividends, while buy and hold you can defer until later. \n2.

The S&P 500 averaged about 5.5%/year from 2000 to 2020, and closer to 1%/year from 2000-2012. \n\n>Wouldn‚Äôt this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn‚Äôt everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?\n\nhere\'s what you\'re missing: \n\n- SPYI\'s 12% yield is only partly dividends. dividends are essentially a form of profit sharing, and the S&P 500 current dividend yield is about 1.3%. if you bought something like SPYD, the highest-dividend stocks in the S&P 500, the yield is about 4%.\n\n- much of the 12% yield from SPYI is due to ""covered calls"", which is a complicated form of options where other investors pay you money for the option to buy the stocks you hold now. \n\n- this can generate a lot of income, and it works well if stocks are steady or going up. but if the stocks go down, you can be forced to sell at a loss to the people who hold the option contract. look up what happened to QYLD a few years ago, similar strategy and it hasn\'t recovered from the Covid crash.']",3,1732196624.0

Snowflake Q3 Earnings,"- Product revenue of $900.3 million in the third quarter, representing 29% year-over-year growth

- Net revenue retention rate of 127%

- 542 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million

- 754 Forbes Global 2000 customers

- Remaining performance obligations of $5.7 billion, representing 55% year-over-year growth

Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025, ended October 31, 2024.

Revenue for the quarter was $942.1 million, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Product revenue for the quarter was $900.3 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Net revenue retention rate was 127% as of October 31, 2024. The company now has 542 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million and 754 Forbes Global 2000 customers, representing 25% and 8% year-over-year growth, respectively. Remaining performance obligations were $5.7 billion, representing 55% year-over-year growth. See the section titled ""Key Business Metrics"" for definitions of product revenue, net revenue retention rate, customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, Forbes Global 2000 customers, and remaining performance obligations.

""Snowflake delivered a strong third quarter, with product revenue of $900 million, up 29% year-over-year, and remaining performance obligations of $5.7 billion, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 55%,"" said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake. ""Our obsessive drive to produce product cohesion and ease of use has built Snowflake into the easiest and most cost effective enterprise data platform. That is what‚Äôs leading us to win new logo after new logo, expand within our customer base, and displace our competition over and over again.""

The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I‚Äôve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I‚Äôve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I‚Äôve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I‚Äôm buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

This though, I don't see it.\n\nIf somehow Opera DID manage to increase their userbase substantially and in a relatively sudden way, I'd be all over it. The fact that they're a profitable company is pretty interesting.\n\nAlso you have to keep in mind that close to half of Opera's revenue is ad/search payments from google for driving traffic to their search. What's bad for google isn't necessarily bad for Opera, but if google cuts their payments for advertising or search referrals, that would be really bad.

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment.¬†

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience.¬†

Let‚Äôs look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ‚â•10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What‚Äôs more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (‚â•30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks.¬†

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn‚Äôt sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I‚Äôve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad.¬†","[""Nothing you mentioned suggests that the company is making any money or will make any money.\n\nEdit: They are, in fact, losing money.\n\nAnd don't ignore the fact that insurance companies are dropping coverage for weight loss drugs."", 'the time to buy was 2 years ago when it was trading around $10-$20 \n\nnow? i think you missed the boat \n\nand tbh, i think it already peaked last year', 'Meh.

""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let\'s illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company\'s upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that\'s really an edge case and isn\'t relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company\'s stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn\'t restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you\'ve been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can\'t trade your own company\'s stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they\'re complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn\'t help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it\'s well-founded (I\'m not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don\'t understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don\'t know is illegal to use.

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.","[""Uff, these Europoors can keep their opinion to themselves.

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm¬†said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm‚Äôs handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*‚Ä≥*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,‚Äù Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running¬†Google¬†Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to¬†Apple¬†for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm‚Äôs strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

‚ÄúWe put a strategy in ‚Äô21, and we‚Äôre not changing our strategy,‚Äù Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by¬†Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

‚ÄúThe competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,‚Äù Amon said, referring to Apple‚Äôs move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. ‚ÄúWe saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.‚Äù

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including¬†Meta¬†for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an ‚Äúedge AI‚Äù company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that‚Äôs typically powered by¬†Nvidia¬†processors. Company officials didn‚Äôt rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that‚Äôs restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

‚ÄúWhat you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,‚Äù Durga Malladi, Qualcomm‚Äôs senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

My personal picks for these three categories are RDW, OKLO and IONQ. Let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options. I have a small stake in all three.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end.¬†I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here‚Äôs something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right‚Ä¶?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I‚Äôm not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o‚Äô business¬† segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase:¬†*for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir‚Äôs stock is.

For starters, let‚Äôs take into consideration palantir‚Äôs enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir‚Äôs enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020:¬†*$1.12*  
2021:¬†*$0.80*  
2022:¬†*$0.92*  
*2*023:¬†*$1.04*  
LTM:¬†*$1.19*¬†

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived¬†*growth*¬†stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this.¬†

But consider this. In their last ‚Äúblowout‚Äù quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate.¬†

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if¬†*all*¬†of Palantir‚Äôs revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy‚Äôs (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*‚ÄúAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?‚Äù*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It‚Äôs not just about justifying the current stock price, it‚Äôs about penciling out¬†*enough upside*¬†in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time.¬†

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It‚Äôs a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear:¬†*their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*.¬†

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it‚Äôs an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end.¬†

As it stands now,¬†*all*¬†of palantir‚Äôs equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share,¬†*all*¬†of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is.¬†

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% -¬†*in revenue!*¬†

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that‚Äôs what makes a market.

Happy investing!","['Palantir has been funny to watch. When it was under $10 Reddit hated it and didn‚Äôt wanna touch it. I made some decent (small) money trading some calls. Wish I had held longer. After selling my calls I bought 100 shares at $20. I recently sold a CC for $60. Because after seeing it run 10x in under 2 years I‚Äôm strongly expecting a pullback. But the shifting sentiment I‚Äôve seen here has been very interesting to watch', 'Nothing that deals with tech is priced properly.

If you use options you're on the clock so that's one more thing working against you, also another rule you should never break, never buy options always sell them. So let's just assume you're going to short shares. If you short $63, your stop would be at 67 on a daily close, not an intra day penetration. There's not really a clear target to the downside though. Maybe $52? But look how much easier this was for the people on the upside. All you have to do is throw a rock at the chart and hold on. For you to make money you have to have your timing right and you have to have a very clear profit target with absolutely no guarantee of that being hit. In fact the way the moving averages and the chart are pointing you're most likely to be stopped out. Still you're only risking $4 to potentially make 10 provided the stock doesn't gap up on you like it has many times before.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12‚Äì15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16‚Äì18 billion, reflecting 6‚Äì9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta‚Äôs leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta‚Äôs significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer‚Äôs overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta‚Äôs investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta‚Äôs NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce‚Äôs SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco‚Äôs cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta‚Äôs NOLs can be applied against Cisco‚Äôs strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16‚Äì18 billion (20‚Äì40% premium).

2025: $18‚Äì22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81‚Äì$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107‚Äì$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29‚Äì75% upside over the next 12‚Äì18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95‚Äì$130 per share.

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)","[""Somewhere in the middle.  Autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off. When that happens, Uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but that's fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own. Uber can also clean/fix self driving cars, but that (which would require stations scattered all around) is a whole other business vs an asset light app.  Some talk that Uber was interested in EXPE and perhaps it tries to diversify (travel super app.)\n\nSo I think somewhere in the middle. I don't think Uber goes away by any means, but I can see Uber looking different/very different 5-10 years from now. Self-driving on a massive scale is still a long ways off, but I do think that it'll probably continue to be a cloud over Uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 5-10+ years from now. On the very short term, stock is getting close to oversold."", ""Waymo has a partnership agreement using the Uber platform. Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of Waymo's vehicles in selected major cities."", ""They have partnership with Waymo, Cruise and other small providers and even if self driving has mass adoption Tesla will not be the only player, it's a matter of time they try to operate on their own and find out it's a pain in the ass and would partner with Uber to dispatch, maintain and also support the rides...it's way to complicated to replicate Uber and operations whether Its self driving or human driven."", 'I own and I believe in the stock. It has many markets for growth, multiple sources of revenue and I believe that autonomous will not disrupt its platform how others are predicting. I think it‚Äôs depressed right now and the concerns are oversold, which is when you want to invest in a growth stock.\n\nRemindMe! 10 years', 'Mass adoption of autonomous driving is still far out, in my opinion. Even when it becomes a thing, one bad incident will cause bad press and concerns for people. There‚Äôs also always going to be people that want an actual human driver.\n\nAs for Uber, I think they‚Äôll be fine.

Two things: One, a lot of money gets made waiting for the future to arrive.  Two, big rich incumbents tend to find ways of owning future developments that come along.\n\nOn that same front, Waymo is so clearly many years ahead of Tesla, and Uber is already partnered with Uber.\n\nShould the landscape and competitive environment truly change, there will time and opportunities to bail in and out as new information indicates.\n\n\nYou have to pass through the near future to get to the wildly distant future.

Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?","[""Good questions, I also use SGOV to store my collateral for CSPs right now so I'm curious to check back for answers.\xa0"", 'Always very short term risk with them. If the rates suddenly go up, early in the month, that means the bond they bought at say 4.5 % could be bought at say a price of 5.5% because of a Fed hike for example, then the present value of those bonds could drop over 1% suddenly. They will still go up the 4.5 % by the end of the month. But you are open to a rare and short term price drop, especially early in the month.', "">risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500\n\nETFs are structured to have 'creation units', which allow institutions to buy or sell blocks of the fund's securities to arbitrage any difference to NAV.

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker¬†Super Micro Computer¬†said on Monday that it‚Äôs hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

‚ÄúThis is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,‚Äù Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a¬†statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having¬†just replaced¬†Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro‚Äôs accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange‚Äôs ‚Äúreview of the compliance plan.‚Äù

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company‚Äôs market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with¬†Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like¬†Dell¬†and¬†Hewlett Packard Enterprise¬†in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn‚Äôt file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified ‚Äúfresh evidence of accounting manipulation.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal¬†later reported¬†that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay,¬†Super Micro said¬†it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn‚Äôt in compliance with the exchange‚Äôs listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq‚Äôs rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

What your take on FMNA/FMCC?,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it‚Äôs a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they‚Äôre up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I‚Äôm invested financially and emotionally.

As mentioned above, the GSEs take market and credit risk\nthat private investors have so far been unwilling to bear. With respect to the credit risk, today there is no\nsignificant market for taking first loss risk on single family mortgages other than prime loans held in\nportfolio on the balance sheets of depository institutions.', 'Why the huge price run in last 60 days?', 'I also bought this before the election with a similar thesis. I clearly, however, bought way too little.', 'Same discussion was brought up last time when Trump was first elected.

The better play is the preferred shares which they need to be redeemed at par or be converted to common stocks. However, volume is extremely low.', 'So I agree with you that they would go up in value a lot if the government control changes.

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don‚Äôt sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up.¬†[SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en)¬†announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.



S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department‚Äôs priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect‚Äôs inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren‚Äôt authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump‚Äôs team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said.¬†

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk‚Äôs plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment.¬†

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla‚Äôs third-quarter earnings call, saying he‚Äôd use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to ‚Äúdismantle government bureaucracy‚Äù and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump‚Äôs first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.","['Hi, you\'re on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you\'re interested in just politics, see our wiki on [""relevant subreddits""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald‚Äôs is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound‚Äôs expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald‚Äôs previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they‚Äôve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry‚Äîone they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald‚Äôs history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it‚Äôs hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald‚Äôs x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were ‚Ç¨1.56 billion, down from ‚Ç¨2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of ‚Ç¨198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to ‚Ç¨160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of ‚Ç¨924.8 million, a significant decrease from the ‚Ç¨472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with ‚Ç¨17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success. This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance. Other thoughts are also open and welcomed!","['I\'m a doctor, and I can explain how things ***really*** work.

Self driving is coming to your favourite cars,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to dive into Mobileye (MBLY) and its role in the self-driving car industry, especially concerning partnerships with major automakers. Let's break it down.

Company Overview:

Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, specializes in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Their EyeQ¬Æ chips and software are integral to many vehicles' safety and automation features.

Key Partnerships:

Mobileye has secured collaborations with several major car manufacturers:

Volkswagen Group: In March 2024, Volkswagen announced a cooperation agreement with Mobileye to develop and supply software, hardware components, and digital maps for the self-driving ID. Buzz AD. 

Ford: Ford has integrated Mobileye's technology into its vehicles, enhancing their ADAS capabilities. 

Zeekr: The Chinese automaker Zeekr has collaborated with Mobileye to incorporate advanced driving technologies into its vehicles. 

Porsche: In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye announced a collaboration to introduce Mobileye's SuperVision‚Ñ¢ automated driver-assist functions in future Porsche sports cars. 


Recent Developments:

In November 2024, Lyft announced partnerships with Mobileye and other companies to integrate self-driving cars into its ride-hailing service. This collaboration aims to advance autonomous vehicle research and development, with plans to launch self-driving taxis in Atlanta next year. 

Financial Performance:

Mobileye's stock has experienced fluctuations. As of November 8, 2024, the stock price was $16.42. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some expressing concerns over growth prospects and competition. 

Future Outlook:

Mobileye's extensive partnerships position it as a significant player in the autonomous driving sector. However, the industry faces challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technological advancements, and competition from other tech companies and automakers developing in-house solutions.

Investment Considerations:

Investors should monitor Mobileye's ability to maintain and expand its partnerships, adapt to technological changes, and navigate the competitive landscape. The company's success in these areas will be crucial for its growth and profitability in the evolving autonomous vehicle market.

What are your thoughts on Mobileye's prospects in the self-driving car industry? Let's discuss!

Tax Loss Harvesting,"Question regarding hedging with tax loss harvesting. What are the pros and cons of this strategy? What am I missing? 

Say I buy $50,000 worth of VOOG today. 

If it drops 6% and I sell, causing a $3k loss, I get to write that off on my taxes. Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I‚Äôd expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I‚Äôm back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation. 

If VOOG goes up, then I happily hold onto the shares and let them rise. ","['I‚Äôm just curious what constitutes a similar security. I think it‚Äôs considered a wash sale if you just turn around and buy something similar right? But what IS similar?', ""That's how it works. The one caveat is that it's not all positive as it changes your cost basis- In your scenario if it goes back up to 50k and you sell it, you'd be taxed on 3k (50-47k) at time of sale. It's more of a tax deferral than just free money."", 'There is no downside to tax loss harvesting as long as you avoid the wash sale rule and find something else that will give similar or better returns.', '[deleted]', ""If you expect VOOG to go back up, why sell it, unless you are offsetting gains, or reducing income for a specific income point (but that's limited to $3k, so not very helpful). \n\nIf you sell today and take a $3k loss sure, you get to deduct that from this year's taxes. But, if QQQ then goes back to $50k, and goes up, then you will owe tax on that gain from $47,000, which could be a bigger tax issue. Maybe, depending on bracket and amount. \n\nIME, tax loss harvesting is rarely much useful. Selling stuff that is no longer worth it is useful - selling just for some TLH normally isn't. \n\nYMMV."", ""Another way to look at it:\n\nSay, you have a mix of stocks in your portfolio valued at $100K (not just a fund). During some good day the mix delivers you, say, $5K return. If you sell the stocks that gained in your mix for $5K, you will pay a capital gain tax on this sale. However, some particular stocks in your mix have probably lost $5K+ of value. So, if you sell those, and next day sell those that gained, your total losses would be larger than the capital gain, and you don't pay tax on those $5K your mix earned.""]",12,1731943362.0
"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports","Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new¬†Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

  
The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers.""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

  
In March, Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter before encountering delays, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms¬†, Alphabet's¬†Google and Microsoft .Nvidia's Blackwell chip takes two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like providing responses from chatbots.","['Right on schedule before earnings', 'I mean, this would definitely be a problem for Nvidia if they had any competitors in this space close to producing an equivalent product.', 'I guess since Reddit is overwhelming short NVDA, it‚Äôs time to all in and go long NVDA?', 'They are overheating only if they build them outside the recommended server configuration.

My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Is PLTR in bubble territory?,"I don‚Äôt own any so this question just stems from curiosity. 

Its market cap was ~$15bn two years ago and is $150bn today. There‚Äôs nothing inherently concerning about that (NVDA was similar, as we all know), but its P/E ratio is 329 - is the rise unsustainable?

I understand Palantir has a lot of positive momentum from AI hype, expected defense spending under Trump, and general recovery of growth stocks as interest rates fall from their highs. These are all valid reasons to expect continued success from Palantir, but are investors irrationally exuberant?

RedCat DD,"I‚Äôm back with the RedCat DD that I promised. 

RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. 

Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the ‚Äúreigning champion‚Äù from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. 

‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?‚Äù

Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. 

As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here‚Äôs a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. 

Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. 

Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don‚Äôt you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?

Fantastic, you‚Äôre right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre losing focus but I‚Äôm certain your wife‚Äôs boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? 

Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18‚Äôs? How about raising taxes and buying both.

I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. 

In case you aren‚Äôt aware, the US Army is America‚Äôs largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they‚Äôll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. 

How about Australia? Here‚Äôs a start.

‚ÄúRed Cat to Supply FlightWave Edge 130 Blue Systems to Royal Australian Navy‚Äù

I hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big Army‚Äôs testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones. SRR is really only the beginning. 

For those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of Taiwan, you might want to give these articles a read.

https://news.usni.org/2024/07/01/hellscape-swarms-could-be-as-cost-effective-taiwan-defense-says-report

The future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems. Why did we leave Vietnam? Unpopularity back home, moms had enough of losing their sons. How long can America sustain a war outspending USD? When America‚Äôs cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and American lives, we might just deter our adversaries in a way they don‚Äôt want to engage us anyways. 

That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America‚Äôs military industrial complex wants on hand? I can‚Äôt give you a definitive answer so unfortunately you‚Äôll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills. I can say, however, that I‚Äôm pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones.

Now, enough ‚Äúmarket‚Äù analysis. Let‚Äôs talk about some numbers. u/CynicalMelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day.

‚ÄúHere is my prediction Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations
Current Market Capitalization: $708.997 million

Current Stock Price: $9.39

Shares Outstanding: Approximately 75.5 million

Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue: $100 million

Industry Revenue Multiple: 20√ó annual revenue

Implied Valuation:

Implied Market Capitalization: $100 million √ó 20 = $2 billion

Implied Stock Price: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately $26.49 per share

Potential Upside: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) √ó 100% = Approximately 182% increase‚Äù

This analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future. 

The stock market is forward looking. Now look forward so you can get an edge. The US drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around 3.94B, expected to increase to 8.65B by 2034. 

https://www.precedenceresearch.com/military-drones-market#:~:text=Military%20Drones%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,7.95%25%20between%202024%20and%202034

Sure maybe the American drone industry will only double over the next 10 years, the thing is, all bets are off if/when we go to war. Where will that money go? 

If you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent, where is your capital going to be safest? This is your opportunity to build some conviction. How will the US stock market hold up if we go to war? Individual companies? How about if we don‚Äôt? Answer those same questions but with RedCat. We get sucked in and large scale war begins, VOO -25%, RCAT +60%. Place your bets.

By current business prospects, RCAT is criminally undervalued. It should have traded at $12 the moment the SRR winner was announced. Also, is there a more reliable source of consistent payments/business than providing services to the US military/government?

This image was not my work, but here is some price modeling data.



If you can buy cheaper than $12, you‚Äôre getting a deal. If you understand the gravity of the SRR win, there is much more to follow. This is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year. Most of yall have never heard the word ‚Äúprofits‚Äù so taxes isn‚Äôt a problem for you, but for the 6 people in here that aren‚Äôt regarded, this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains. Buy calls, exercise them or sell them, buy shares keep them, whatever you wanna do. This company is promising with a bright future. I do apologize that I didn‚Äôt post this earlier. I have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed. (Until a few days ago it‚Äôs been under 500M market cap. Wanted and tried to post DD back in July) 

Ask your questions and I‚Äôll do the best I can to answer them.

Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting‚ÄîThe Journey is Far from Over üöÄ,"**Alright everbody, let‚Äôs talk about where we‚Äôre at with ACHR:**

Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs been happening. We‚Äôve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:

**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  
Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.

**381 Funds are on Board**  
Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions‚Äîup 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer‚Äôs growth. Big money sees the potential.

**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  
Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:

* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.
* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.

This aligns with the momentum we‚Äôve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn‚Äôt just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.

**Major NYC News**  
Archer‚Äôs partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.

**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  
Archer‚Äôs plans go beyond the U.S., they‚Äôre actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:

1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.
2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.
3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.

India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer‚Äôs biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.

**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  
Archer‚Äôs new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.

**The Journey Continues**  
For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it‚Äôs not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren‚Äôt guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there‚Äôs no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.

**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn‚Äôt over yet, join if you‚Äôre ready to see what‚Äôs next. üöÄ

Wishing everyone a great Thanksgiving and hoping for some gains this week to cover an extra turkey or two! ü¶É

"$CBL: The Shopping REIT that Screws Banks and Has 2-3x Upside to Comps
","***TL;DR at Bottom for my ADHD brethren.***

CBL is playing 4D chess in the retail REIT game. Unlike the high majority retail REITS I‚Äôve seen, it has non-recourse loans. What does that mean? It means that if a property isn‚Äôt pulling its weight, they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away. To simplify:

1. CBL buys a property with loans (like a mortgage)
2. Property works out - CBL wins
3. Property doesn‚Äôt work out - CBL can simply walk away and the bank takes the property, but ***cannot go after other assets!*** CBL only loses what they put in (analogous to down payment... not a huge L)

This is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers. Depending on what comp you use, it seems like CBL could fairly be 2-3x higher in stock price. It has **better** operating metrics and ROIC:

https://preview.redd.it/cpx617lh763e1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=119457849d20a7ace07d57e732056d0040ab4f46

*So, if it‚Äôs so great, who owns it?*

Well, there‚Äôs 64.5% insider ownership‚Ä¶ this is insanely high so management and insiders like Oaktree (Howard Marks) think it looks good. But this has a side effect that is negative for exposure: it also makes the float low, so institutions can‚Äôt easily buy in. But to solve this problem, CBL is using its 17% cash flow yield to buy back shares. They've nuked 8% of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure.¬†

So essentially, this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties, and is now printing cash, buying back shares, and bullying lenders. There are several catalysts on the near horizon:

1. Lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company, so if the economy shows softness, which it has, rates will come down even more and help it.
2. The company recently has had great momentum (+10% in past month) and this indicates more and more interest.
3. New buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in Feb

*Here‚Äôs what makes it especially interesting. As far as I can tell, sh-rts were fairly lazy and just thought:*

‚ÄúHmm, this is some random shopping mall REIT, hurr durr let‚Äôs sell it. Plus, it emerged from bankruptcy, it must have had bad performance‚Ä¶ yep hurr durr‚Äù¬†

This has led to 16% SI which is very significant for this sector.

If you are generally concerned with this play, I would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other, lesser performing REITs, which should get rid of most sector risk. Then you sit around and wait. Management is insanely aligned with you, the company is on fire, and it‚Äôs going to get even better if rates lower. In the meantime, you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back.

I bought calls that expire after the next FOMC, which should be a good catalyst if they lower rates. I‚Äôve been banking so far:

MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,"Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.

But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.

According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...

1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.
2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.
3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.

With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.

So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.

Does this end poorly? Probably. But for now the music is playing, and we all have to dance.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 1285 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkqsfl/shopify_short_this_biatch/) \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Clearly in 2024 we finally found a risk free asset, they thought bundled mortgages are the thing but no, MSTR has brought us something much more secure!

$PCT (Purecycle) is on the prowl and ready to explode. Get in while you can,"So you're rolling in money from AsSTiTs, $RKLB, and $ACHR. You're too scared to YOLO into $MSTR. $PCT is now at a similar stage as when AsSTiTs had their first test satellite in the air or Archer first flew their eVTOL. They've shown it can work; now comes the commercialization and scaling.

PureCycle has invented a revolutionary new way to recycle plastic. Most plastic you put in the recycle bin today [gets burned or thrown away](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/california-sues-exxonmobil-plastic-recycling-deception-rcna172267). They've finally figured out a way to actually re-use this shit (recycle symbol #5) and are scaling up production and signing contrats right now, just so you can get in on the ground floor. Other brands want their product because it makes them look good to their customers that they're using recycled plastic, and it's cheaper too I'm pretty sure.

*1. The Technology*

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018)

These guys have been dropping corporate hype videos in recent weeks because they're finally getting cocky that their shit works. I'm honestly not exactly sure what's happening here, but it seems like the new plastic they're making in their Ohio factory is pure as hell.

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911)

Here's another video from today of their CEO flexing their facility in Denver which apparently sources old plastic to make the new plastic. Again not entirely sure what I'm looking at here, but [this guy is a dawg and lives for this shit](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988), which is what you want in a CEO. My takeaway is they finally are getting quality old plastic to make into elite new plastic, at scale.

They also have a sick new R&D facility in North Carolina to learn how to keep churning out purer and purer product.

*2. Commercial Demand*

This tech was actually made by P&G and licensed to PureCycle to scale. P&G is their first customer. In addition, [according to their 10-Q](https://ir.purecycle.com/sec-filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-24-127556/0000950170-24-127556.pdf), ""PureCycle has allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated."" I'm pretty sure that means that for their second factory in Georgia, they already have 40% of sales made and are actively working on the rest.

Now that the tech works, their focus this year and Q1/Q2 2025 is commercialization. This is the time to get in, because once they announce those juicy contracts, this thing is gone.

To be clear, this is a risky pre-revenue growth company so scaling is not guaranteed. However, it finally seems to be de-risked enough from a technology standpoint, and the deals they're making now show this.

*3. Financials*

[Their ex-CFO said they were modeling their profit margins to be 40-60%.](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988) They're taking shit that people don't want and would actually pay to get rid of and making it useful. They still may need to raise more shares to fund all their build out.

Short interest is high but the price is on an up trend. They will eventually need to cover.

PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq¬†because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one.¬†**The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all¬†**points back to one fundamental goal**¬†of the company's management:¬†**manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are¬†**not**¬†part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:**¬†In a¬†**direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is¬†**no lock-up period**¬†(common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6‚Äì12 months). This approach ensures a¬†**larger float**¬†right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the¬†**first week**¬†of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses¬†**Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company‚Äôs market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted¬†Market¬†Cap=Share¬†Price√óFree¬†Float¬†Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the ‚Äúeffective float‚Äù rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by¬†[investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically¬†[buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its¬†**relisting to Nasdaq**¬†to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index‚Äôs modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap‚Äîexactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir‚Äôs ownership by the big three institutional investors‚ÄîVanguard, BlackRock, and State Street‚Äîhas soared to an impressive¬†**22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like¬†**Microsoft (20.5%)**,¬†**Apple (20.0%)**, and¬†**NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 17 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Too bad no one at SEC cares about anything', 'So what you are saying is that they are masterfully manipulating the price to go up?

Palantir\xa0**did**\xa0impose a modified lock-up period, as documented in its SEC filings (Form 8-K and Free Writing Prospectus). While direct listings usually avoid traditional lock-ups, Palantir restricted 80% of insider shares for 6 months until February 2021 (from September 2020 ) after the Q4 2020 earnings release. Insiders (employees, early investors, etc.) were allowed to sell up to\xa0**20% of their holdings immediately**.\n2. I think you misunderstand what happened with the SPACs- It definitely is a grey area but not illegal so its more like gaming the system. The SPAC revenue did improve Palantir‚Äôs reported revenue growth, but profitability (a key factor for S&P 500 inclusion) remained elusive until 2024. SPAC-related revenue didn‚Äôt directly manipulate inclusion; it was a short-term boost that eventually faded.\n\nPalantir\'s growth during this time was largely organic, which makes the argument about ""juicing their books"" with SPAC investments less convincing. Sure, SPACs may have temporarily boosted revenue by locking in software contracts, but how do you sustain that growth and actually become profitable without constantly reinvesting in new SPACs? You don‚Äôt.\n\nPalantir didn‚Äôt invest in any SPACs in 2023 or 2024, so their profitability by 2024 couldn‚Äôt have come from ""artificially inflated revenue"" tied to SPACs. Why? Because not all of those SPAC-backed companies succeeded, and without new SPAC investments to keep the cycle going, they had to shift to real, organic growth to move toward profitability.\n\nFinal notes: The S&P 500 requires a company to be\xa0**profitable on a GAAP basis**\xa0for the most recent quarter and the trailing four quarters combined. Palantir was not GAAP profitable until 2023 for the first time. So they weren\'t able to be added to the indices right away like you claim.\n\nThis is all the time I have to spare for now.

BSF estimates, 1y HV= $1.57 and 2y HV = $1.77.

The price at close is $1.94. (11/25/2025)

I know this is just an estimate, but I'm thinking of placing a Trailing Stop Loss.

I wouldn't dare make it $0.17 or even $0.40, but should I even be thinking about this at this point with my expiration date being 4/17/2025???

DOJ doesn't understand software and why GOOGL is an obvious play,"so the government want to split Chrome off Google? this is a win win scenario for anyone who picks up any Google stock and Google itself:

1. They do split it. Google goes about it's business making billions and now Chrome belongs to someone else or in its own thing. Google can just launch a new browser off Chromium open source project. Heck even if somehow they are forbidden from ever launching a browser again they can get away influencing the Chrome foundation or whatever like they've done with Mozilla through partnership/donations. It's not like their core business is Chrome anyways. Same deal goes with Android they can fork or influence even post split. Maybe if they took YouTube they'd be hit badly but still carry on making dough off search alone.

2. They don't split it. Biz as usual but you just got in a good entry point.

Energy Fuels ($UUUU) Poised for Significant Growth ,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium ‚Äì** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Vanadium -** A key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

[SWOT on VRFBs \(Guidehouse Insights\)](https://preview.redd.it/hdo1sh30b63e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=00b8475a300ff27114ef53227ba065ed9aac70e6)

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE‚Äôs)**

**NdPr ‚Äì** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets called NdFeB magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

[Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition \(Source: Adamas Intelligence\)](https://preview.redd.it/emv9f387b63e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7fdf6e3529464c02aad7a72ac3bf77b085dfe8)

**NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important**

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet. They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact. With the energy transition going on, demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY.

[Demand for NdFeB Magnets Worldwide From 2018-2022](https://preview.redd.it/f5b3fz7jb63e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d0bb2e67b54e51d9768ea70da74b4dfe588d942)

[NdFeB Magnet Content](https://preview.redd.it/mskkzhrkb63e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dd18a81424cf054c82013eeb60c6a6daf2c11ef)

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite ‚Äì** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon ‚Äì** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile ‚Äì** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite ‚Äì** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements such as NdPr and elements like uranium and thorium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors at White Mesa Mill. 

[Energy Fuels Competitive Advantage](https://preview.redd.it/ibs82oz9c63e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3d64214d19c01d1c7db8e4c6e9fbca5278d615)

**White Mesa Mill**

¬∑¬†100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE‚Äôs.

¬∑¬†The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

¬∑¬†Completed ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

¬∑¬†Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low vanadium prices, strong inventory on hand.

**Price and Financial History**

YTD Return -3.20%.

1 Year Return -17.63.

5 Year Return +244.55%

Since 2007 -96.15%

https://preview.redd.it/kb4uuddnc63e1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=665f2ef73497e40e480d27c620f9b1c7e5c533bf

Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196%.

I know these numbers don't look great. The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about in my opinion. Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding. Although, once these mines are up and running, heavy mineral sands mining is low cost. Combined with the high price of uranium, profitability is so close. They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets. The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities, with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023. In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

¬†**Q3 2024 Highlights**

¬∑ Very good balance sheet with over $180 million of liquidity and no debt.

¬∑¬†Uranium prices continue to drive revenue. Sold 50,000 pounds of U3O8 at spot price of $80. Proceeds totaling $4 million, gross profit margin of 54%.

¬∑¬†New long-term uranium contract. Expected delivery of 270,000-330,000 pounds between 2026 and 2027.

¬∑ Produced 38 tonnes of separated NdPr at White Mesa Mill.

¬∑¬†NdPr produced at White Mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers, setting the stage for growth.

¬∑¬†Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235,000 pounds finished U3O8. 805,000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials. Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations.

¬∑¬†A large vanadium inventory of 905,000 pounds finished V2O5.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to strategic growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 1-2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 9 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 21 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g4leam/why_the_uranium_bull_market_will_continue/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g4m0m6/why_i_believe_the_bull_market_for_uranium_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g4mt99/why_i_believe_the_bull_market_for_uranium_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fn1c62/why_i_believe_palantir_pltr_will_continue_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fn2tq4/why_i_believe_palantir_pltr_will_continue_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxio2s/i_think_paypal_is_still_very_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h03qvl/energy_fuels_uuuu_poised_for_significant_growth/) \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Long ass DD = me not reading a single word but getting in because you took the time to do it. \n\nThanks.', 'Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

Orange Juice Crisis,"# Overview

There is currently an ongoing orange juice crisis. Here, I explain what is happening in the orange market, and what metrics/information an orange investor should look out for.

# Context: A Perfect Shitstorm of Weather and Disease

Orange juice has become very expensive. So much so, that OJ has been one of the top performers in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (excluding BTC) since 2020. Below is a graphical representation.

https://preview.redd.it/isa4u6bz273e1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=4351eccf9b1ea2066b8d282a3907fcc913dd41e5

*Fig 1. Orange Juice Futures (candlestick) vs. major commodities, Crude Oil (Green), Copper (Blue), Gold (Purple), Silver (Mint), Soybeans (Red).*

Since 2020, OJ has risen in price by more than 350%. This dwarfs the performance of other major commodities, some of which had arguably very good runs themselves.

So what exactly happened to OJ? There are two, both of which concern the crop‚Äôs supply side: adverse weather events and citrus greening.

First, on adverse weather: climate change is nothing new. As of late, however, the damage done to crops due to extreme weather effects seem to be on the rise both in terms of frequency and intensity. It also just happens so that Brazil was hit the hardest, recording its hottest ever temperature in 2023. This is serious news for OJ, [because Brazil alone supplies 70% of the world market](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/orange-juice-makers-consider-other-fruits-prices-bananas-brazil-harvest). Needless to say, extreme heat is never good for crops - for oranges in particular, it significantly increases premature fruit drops, which diminishes yields for plantations.

*Fig 2. Brazil Change in Average Mean Surface Air Temperature, 1901-2022; source: World Bank Group. Temperature in Brazil has been steadily increasing since the 1950s.*

*Fig 3. Brazil Change in Distribution of Average Maximum Surface Air Temperature, 1951-2020 ; source: World Bank Group. Not only has the average temperature been rising in Brazil, the extremities of droughts are also trending upwards. Extremities are the real crop killers.*

To get the absolutely worst outcome, combine this with a tree disease that has no known cure: citrus greening. Citrus greening causes citrus fruit to stay green instead of ripening, turning it bitter and inedible, and causes the trees to produce less fruit over time. Once a tree is infected, it typically dies within 5-10 years. There is currently no known cure. The disease is also highly contagious. [Virtually all trees in Florida, which used to top even Brazil in OJ production at one time, is infected by citrus greening](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/04/florida-citrus-growers-hope-push-pull-agroecology-method-will-save-their-industry/). Florida barely produces any oranges these days, and most juice makers have already left their groves (Fig 4). As for Brazil, \[Fundecitrus estimated in 2023 that 38% of the plants in the Brazilian citrus belt had symptoms of citrus greening\]([https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:\~:text=The citrus belt%2C however%2C also,have symptoms of the disease.)](https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:~:text=The%20citrus%20belt%2C%20however%2C%20also,have%20symptoms%20of%20the%20disease.)).

*Fig 4. US Domestic Production of Oranges. Florida now makes less than 1/10 of what it used to make just 20 years ago. Most citrus trees died due to citrus greening, and most grove owners never replanted.*

As a result, OJ inventory is currently at historically low levels (Fig 5, Fig 6), which explains the squeeze in its price. [USDA estimated that the 2022-2023 growing season for citrus was the least productive since 1936.](https://www.wusf.org/environment/2023-05-08/20-year-fight-citrus-greening-florida-farmers-researchers-exhausted)

*Fig 6. US OJ cold storage stocks. Inventory has decreased from 620 million lbs in 2021 to 210  in 2024; a near 70% drop in just three years.*

# Future of Orange Juice

So where will the price of OJ be in the next few years? This is where we get into speculative territory, though the most natural response from a degen ape would be to short the hell out of this thing. Before we do so, however, let us look at some reasons why OJ will have no choice but to come down in price.

**(Somewhat) Predictable Nature of the Ni√±o Index**

Extreme heat that damages crops in Southern Brazil (where the citrus belt is located) is almost always is accompanied by El Ni√±o. El Ni√±o occurs when the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm, causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others. La Ni√±a is the opposite pattern, where the same region of the Pacific becomes cooler than normal, also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions. These patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently, based on its geographical location. For Brazil, and the citrus belt in particular, El Ni√±o is the more serious problem, because El Ni√±o generally brings heat while La Ni√±a takes it away.

https://preview.redd.it/7etys2n8373e1.png?width=2498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6baeac6f66db2abbd2b3f8a236c72d8609153882

*Fig 7. Ni√±o Index; source: Golden Gate Weather Services. Just from a glance, the index seems to closely resemble a normal distribution. Extreme events happen at lower frequencies than less extreme events, and the index oscillates between El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a in a predictable pattern.*

Heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering Brazil's citrus production in the 2022-2023 growing season (CitrusBR). This means that as long as we don't see another very strong El Ni√±o in the near future, we can be assured of successful orange harvests in Brazil. Based on historical data (Fig 7), the Ni√±o index seems to follow a normal distribution, with La Ni√±a usually following strong El Ni√±os. Given the fact that we just had a very strong El Ni√±o in 2023, there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years.

If this is true, a cooler temperature in Brazil for the next 1-3 years should increase output and put downward pressure back on the price of OJ. Strong caveat: nobody can forecast the weather with 100% accuracy. That is why I say 'somewhat'. But the math seems grounded, and nature at least mean-reverting.

**Substitution Effect**

We can also rely on macroeconomic forces to make forecasts.

OJ is not a need. It is also has many substitutes. Consumers have a variety of juices to choose from in the supermarket. If OJ is too expensive, they can easily buy apple or grapefruit juice. Moreover, [retail juice makers (e.g., coca-cola) are looking to use alternative fruits like mandarins to produce their orange juice](https://www.newsweek.com/companies-may-stop-using-oranges-make-orange-juice-1905954).

Therefore, in the long-term, even in the unlikely scenario where the citrus supply shock never recovers, high prices for OJ will drive demand down, ultimately leading to a lower price. High price is the cure for high prices for goods that have clear substitutes and are not Veblen.

**Potential Cure for Citrus Greening**

[Scientists in Florida may have found the cure for citrus greening.](https://theconversation.com/trees-own-beneficial-microbiome-could-lead-to-discovery-of-new-treatments-to-fight-citrus-greening-disease-232681) However, the work is only preliminary and more time and tests will be needed to prove its efficacy.

# Notes on Trading OJ

OJ can be shorted on ICE Futures. 1pt move on an OJ contract translates to a $150 P/L. Current price of OJ is 513.10. The average price of OJ pre-supply shock was approximately 130. Assuming that the current price reverts back to the mean, an investor can therefore expect to make a profit of $57,450 with a \~$20k maintenance margin per contract. The actual profit will most likely be lower, however, because of the big spreads in OJ (OJ is not a liquid contract) and rollover risk. Still, OJ presents a good opportunity for speculators at this point in time, for reasons mentioned above.

**TLDR; OJ is overpriced. Short it at your own risk.**","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 8 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', ""Fuck you, I've seen trading places"", ""They'll probably just dilute orange juice even more than it is now to avoid a crisis.

Stock Market: An Overspeculation Environment,"There are eery comparisions to the dot-com bubble, it is becoming increasingly hard to believe that a rising industry such as the AI one is worth what investors are betting its worth.

Top 5 Positions in the S&P500 index as of as of 11/22/2024.

|5|Meta Platforms, Inc. Class A|2.42%|564.78|

Now lets look at the P/E of these companies:

The revenues that these companies are generating are not at all adjusted to the prices at which their stocks are trading at, we are in a overconcentrated and overvalued market environment.

This is exactly what happened in 2001 with the dot-com bubble, companies were trading at absurd levels driven by the speculation that the internet would revolutionize the world and so anyone with a few spare bills dumped them into the market, deeming anything "".com"" was good enough.

The same is happening today with AI, we started with NVIDIA and we are still in the honeymoon phase with it, however we are starting to see many other AI related startups and companies, there is a big speculation about this industry and the idea that it will revolutionize the world, altough it most likely will we must have into account that this is the economy we are talking about, and we are talking about fair value.

I would like to read your opinions on this if you are concerned at all and if you believe 2025 will bring a correction to the markets or we continue to fuel up this, so called, ""bubble"" (dont call me bubble boy).

And! Earnings haven't happened yet. They're coming on the first week of December. Given the sheer amount of data PL generates, there's a massive AI platform to be built. This has kicked off in earnest.

Positions: 1250 in $5 calls for early December.

üîã Bloom Energy‚Äôs 95% Run: The Hidden Energy Play Behind AI Data Centers,"**Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% on Nov 15 and is now up 95%.**  
While it‚Äôs unclear if the rally will pause or continue‚Äîand you should be mindful that, as I just said, she has already soared 95%‚Äîthis post explores why this move is more than a short-term trend, with highly significant catalysts on the horizon.

[Bloom Energy servers](https://preview.redd.it/j6j1akk2x43e1.jpg?width=3912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb781f61de55753b16b0ff00433654d603615d53)

AI is booming, and it‚Äôs not a fad. Have you heard of NVDA? Of course you have, and you know the demand for its semiconductors is insane. Here are key insights from last Wednesday‚Äôs NVDA earnings call:

* Hopper demand is exceptional.
* Blackwell demand is staggering.
* NVDA is racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand.
* The next wave of AI is Enterprise AI and Industrial AI.

\-----

AI isn‚Äôt just the future‚Äîit‚Äôs here and scaling rapidly. These semiconductors are being used to build advanced data centers. **But to turn on these data centers, you cannot just plug all that processing power into the wall outlet. They require specialized power setups from their local energy utility.**

Connecting a data center to the grid requires major upgrades due to their immense energy demands and need for reliability:

**Dedicated Substations:** Data centers need substations with high-capacity transformers and switchgear to step down grid power. Building or upgrading a substation can take 2‚Äì3 years due to permitting, engineering, and construction delays.

**Transmission Line Upgrades:** High-voltage lines may need new installations, conductor upgrades, or pole reinforcements, often delayed by land acquisition, environmental reviews, and public opposition.

**Distribution Network Enhancements:** Local networks require upgrades like redundant feeders, voltage regulators, and new lines to ensure stable delivery from substations to data centers.

**Redundancy and Reliability:** To meet 99.999% uptime demands, utilities need to build costly redundant systems, including backup transmission lines and ring configurations, to eliminate single points of failure.

Furthermore, data centers consume immense amounts of electricity, often beyond what utilities can supply. Slow by nature, utilities are vastly unprepared for the AI-driven demand surge, and they are struggling to respond.

Besides, upgrading grid infrastructure requires billions of dollars and takes years, with delays from zoning, public consultations, and environmental reviews. As a result, companies that want to develop their data centers face growing waiting lists for power, risking their competitive edge in an industry where delays of even months can be critical.

**This isn‚Äôt hypothetical‚Äîit‚Äôs happening now.** I‚Äôve included several sources and citations at the end.

\-----

Enter Bloom Energy ($BE), which sells on-site power generators that can run data centers **without relying on the grid**‚Äîa proven solution used for years in hospitals, factories, and off-grid installations.

On Nov 14 (after-hours), American Electric Power (AEP), a major utility that operates in 11 states and is struggling to meet data center energy demands, struck a deal with Bloom Energy. Instead of making clients wait years or relocate, AEP will offer Bloom‚Äôs energy servers, enabling data centers to power up in months, not years, and stay competitive.

This is a game-changer for Bloom Energy. They‚Äôve shifted from selling servers to individual clients to partnering with utility giant AEP‚Äîa move from retail to wholesale.

Bloom‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt new, but the AEP deal marks a leap to scalable, utility-scale partnerships, unlocking massive demand.

\-----

A company wanting to develop a data center: ‚ÄúI need energy for my data center!‚Äù  
AEP: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be able to accommodate you until mid-2027. You can wait, move to a location where the grid is already upgraded (but you need to hurry because those spaces are limited), or we can install these Bloom Energy servers and you‚Äôll have your energy in 90 days.‚Äù

For those who grasp this jump from retail to wholesale, the opportunity is clear.  
Careful, though. My entry was over a week ago, and she has been running a lot already. However, every new AEP order or, fingers crossed, any other major utility signing a new agreement with Bloom Energy? Wink emoji.

Do your own research, though. And for those who want to dive deeper into the details, here are the sources I used to inform my play:

Personally, I‚Äôm playing with shares ($18.24, and I'm posting now because I was BanBet-banned last week).  
And again, she could keep running north, but be careful. However, this stock is something you should keep on a watchlist.

\-----

TL;DR: Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% after a deal with AEP, a major utility struggling to meet energy demands from AI-driven data centers. BE‚Äôs on-site energy servers bypass the grid, enabling data centers to power up in months instead of years. This shifts BE from retail to wholesale, unlocking massive potential.

"Elon Musk Sparks Controversy Over F-35 Fighter Jets, Advocates for Drone Warfare","Tesla CEO Elon Musk, co-head of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter on his social media platform, X, while endorsing drones over manned fighter jets. Musk referred to the F-35's design as flawed and called manned jets obsolete in the era of advanced drone warfare. His comments sparked a heated online debate and triggered a dip in the stock prices of Lockheed Martin (-4.5%), Northrop Grumman (-3.2%), and RTX (-1.6%).

The Pentagon defended the F-35, emphasizing its global adoption by allies and its vital role in defense, while Lockheed Martin reaffirmed its commitment to the jet's capabilities. Critics point to the program‚Äôs high costs, delays, and reliability issues, with the total cost of the F-35 program estimated at $1.8 trillion.

Musk argued that the F-35‚Äôs design suffered from attempting to meet the diverse needs of multiple military branches, making it an expensive and inefficient ""jack of all trades."" He highlighted the Pentagon's history of fiscal inefficiencies, noting its recent failure to pass a seventh consecutive audit.

Meanwhile, the defense industry is increasingly exploring drone-based solutions, with startups like Anduril and Redcat playing a prominent role in innovating unmanned combat systems. Despite Musk's critique, the Pentagon continues to plan for a mixed fleet of manned and unmanned aircraft.

How many people here have actually changed their lives trading? For the better or worse? ,"Has WSB played a part in your success or failure? Lastly, for those who have changed their lives for the better, what strategies helped you make the most money? And for those who have changed their lives for the worst, how did it happen and what keeps you coming back?

I‚Äôve been inspired by the subreddit and am looking to hear the honest experiences and perspectives of others here on a more serious note before diving into the deep end. Ironically, what is most inspiring to me is the loss porn - there‚Äôs something about seeing someone lose more than you have in one day and be unphased that moves you.

Now I‚Äôm looking to take trading seriously, not quit my job and go full-time, but devote all my spare time to it.

For context, I‚Äôve been in and out the market for years, so I am not a complete beginner, but have never taken trading ‚Äúseriously‚Äù before now. I‚Äôve joined call out groups twice in the past, but was lost between the lingo and how fast everything was moving. Now I am going to learn to trade on my own. My current plan is to start with ~$500 and focus on ETF options (SPY, QQQ, IWM), though I will also keep my eyes open for news and catalyst plays that I have the buying power for. I am going to use price action and full timeframe continuity to look for openings, as that is what I currently know and research other strategies as I go. I am also researching tools this time around because I‚Äôve had trouble with order blocks and resting liquidity in the past which would have gave me better insight into how price might react to hitting a level. My current risk management strategy is limit entries to 20% of my portfolio with a 20% loss tolerance/stop loss (I will likely be focusing on IWM while I build my account), limiting my losses to 4% per entry. My plan is to lower the entry limit as my account grows but increase my loss tolerance per entry to maybe 35%. I will be using a cash account to avoid bitting off more than I can chew and margin interest cutting into potential profits.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 6 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'I have a $50,000 debt and nothing to show for it coz I thought i could make it big trading', 'Instead of spending hours scrolling through the cesspool that is general Reddit everyday, I spend hours scrolling through this dumpster fire of a sub.

I am short e.l.f Beauty Inc (ELF),"e.l.f. Beauty Inc is a US based cosmetics: make up & skin care company.

On November 20th 2024, Muddy Waters published a report (available on the website) on alleged irregularities in sales, revenue and profits reported by ELF in last 2-3 quaters.

Muddy Waters asserts the ELF imports 80% of its products from China and as per US imports customs data there has been a steep fall in import volumes. Therefore, ELF may have overstated its profits by 135-190 M$ in last 2-3 quarters.

On the otherhand, ELF has continued to state that the demand is increasing and therefore it has boosted its inventory to cater to its customers.

ELF published a rebuttal <https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-issues-120000178.html?utm_source=perplexity> which states that it has taken permission to hide its import volumes since Feb 2024 to protect the business volumes against competition. Therefore Muddy Waters allegations as baseless as they are working with incomplete data sets.

In my opinion, the response by ELF is very weak and unconvincing.

Therefore, I have taken short position through PUT options [100$ strike price and 17th January expiry].

Clawed my way out of the hole,"Finally back in the green over all time üòÇüò≠ 

Made a bad call back in March holding onto what seemed like a pretty safe call debit spread on SMCI (actually posted about it back then too lmao üò¨). Long story short SMCI closed right at the short leg strike point, so whoever was holding onto the 10 contracts I was short on decided not to exercise, leaving me long on 1000 very pricey and very volatile shares of SMCI. Ended up getting margin called that weekend and losing almost 11k when markets opened that Monday üôÉ

Proceeded to make a series of bad panic option trades on NVDA and Adobe over the following months trying to recoup my losses, dropping me further into the red. Was down about 18k at the beginning of September

Finally had a stroke of luck with a well played call spread on MSI (posted about that too), then rode the election wave up to the green over the past few weeks. Special thanks to RDDT and TSLA üôè

Will $NVCR have a rebound?,"The company produces medical devices to treat cancer in a novel way, using ""Tumor Treating Fields"". First product was a helmet, for brain tumors. It's a niche. No other company do the same. Competition is ""classical"" medical approaches.

Company isn't profitable, but revenues keep growing.

They are exploring new products, for treating more types of cancers. They had a failed trial for ovarian cancer, which caused a major drop in stock price. They got FDA approval recently for a type of lung cancer. Other products are in trials.

All time high is around 220, in 2021. current price 18.

Does anyone have an opinion on this stock? Is anyone watching it? I am wondering whether it can go back to Covid levels. Seems like the company is in better situation than back then.

According to LinkedIn, they are actively hiring, with around 50 open positions, and the head count growth is 2% in the last 6 months. Seem like positive indicators to me.

Will crowdstrike strike back?,"Today is the earning day for crowdstrike. I am amazed that it was able to recover the loss due to July outage in just 4 mths. This is more impressive than Intel or Boeing. 

Competitors such as PANW and FTNT have reported beat expectations but slower growth y-o-y. I think growth for cybersecurity companies is turning.  
In sept, CrowdStrike launched the Customer Commitment Packages (CCP) and Falcon Flex Pricing to dangle carrot of discount to clients. This sure eat up the margin.  
And yes, Delta sued crowdstrike.  For sure, I think crowdstrike will need to own some responsibility and pay compensation but not sure the figures.  
And lastly, have anyone seen its PE ratio? unbelievable.

Almost all analysts are singing praises of crowdstrike and this makes me more doubtful. Earnings target was set so low that I believe CRWD will beat easily. Sounds like easy money, right?

$MARA DD - The MaraStrategy üíä,"üì¢Preface

Disclaimer: I use a cringe amount of emoji ü´£ also the following is not not financial advice. If you lose money that's too bad, you gain a life lesson.

Illiterate? => Scroll to the bottom, follow instructions üëá

Disclosure: As of Nov 22nd I have \~8k in various $MARA calls + some additional funds to buy $MARA stock on dips. I will instantly buy more if Fred Thiel keeps employing the ""MaraStrategy""

Most of this DD focuses on $MARA compared to $MSTR, I compared multiple tickers before determining $MARA was the best play.

With that out of the way, lets dive into the always sunny bull case for $MARA  
\---

üíäMaraStrategy

For this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for $BTC to go down and it just continues going up. Think: 'sToNkS oNlY gO uP' type shit üòå

Thanks to the pioneers and investors in MicroStrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself. $MARA or Marathon Digital Holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin, a shit-ton of it. In fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest $BTC holdings after $MSTR.

The ""MaraStrategy"" (codename: üíä) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.

$MARA happens to be in the best position to replicate what $MSTR is doing.  
\- They have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector.  
\- A forward thinking CEO (s/o Fredüëã) who has already began executing the MicroStrategy model.  
\- One of the strongest mining operations.  
\- Fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving.  
\- A growing reputation of HODLing $BTC. ¬†

So why not just buy $MSTR? ""They were first!"" They will come out on top... right? Yes and no. They are currently utilizing their $BTC holdings better than anyone else. However, the $BTC value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in, driving it higher as shares are diluted. $MSTR still has to pay their ""debts"" over time (which is crucial because $BTC takes time to go up \[I'm simplifying this slightly\]). Plus their option premiums are pricey üò§

We are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with $BTC, daily.

To be clear I am not saying $MSTR is done running at all. My conviction is simply that $MARA presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get (fuck you) money from (irresponsible) option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison ü§ë

Hopefully you kept in mind what I said about $BTC not going down, it helps understand the premise.  
Also its true (facts no cap on god frfr), $BTC is just going to keep rising, its inevitable. Although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit... but its a bull market so we're throwing caution to the wind üôÉ  
\---

ü§ØCatalysts

If I can ask you to only read and consider one of these, really have a deep think üß† on the first one, the rest are bonuses:

‚Çøitcoin - I was a skeptic years ago, now adoption is imminent. Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency. The biggest catalyst of all is the value of $BTC and the fact it's being adopted by EVERY person, EVERY business and EVERY country. The people drove the companies to invest and the companies are driving the countries to invest. Read it again. It's a rich man's world and they are going to want to ensure their wealth is secured. Without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways. Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation. No one knows what price $BTC is going to but I bet my dick it's much higher than 100k üöÄ

Continued aggressive purchasing of $BTC, the sooner the better. Fred Theil needs to show he's committed to following the MaraStrategy model. Then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more $BTC and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value.

Investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action. It is easier to access bitcoin now because you don't have to directly buy $BTC, $MSTR, $IBIT and now $MARA give simple, cheap and liquid ways to diversify in $BTC as fiat currency loses some ""market share"" to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin commonly held by public companies/governments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out. Especially for public companies where cash holdings are scrutinized, do you really believe undiversified cash reserves are going to remain competitive? Chew on this, $BTC has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen $MSTR has been outperforming a majority of companies, less than a year ago it was valued at less than 10B now its valued 10x higher at nearly 100B, they have 33B in $BTC alone. This isn't some small cap ssq run up, it's leveraged to the tits ü´¶ but its achieving incredible value.

Infinite Money Glitch ü§Ø $BTC goes up, which means $MARA's holdings go up, profits per coin from mining goes up, stock goes up, allows them to buy more $BTC, $BTC goes up ‚ôªÔ∏è $MARA has the perfect supporting business for this they are literally PRINTING MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, must be funny.

There is a critical mass where companies and countries all start jumping in, buying $BTC and that causes $BTC to go fucking parabolic and $MARA to go marabolic -- its about to be a goddamn gold rush and picks ‚õèÔ∏è are on sale.

Small positives but worth noting  
\- Mining stocks are finally catching up to $BTC giving some extra momentum and volume  
\- China does the most mining in the world and its courts just confirmed $BTC is property and therefore is now legal for cities to own.  
\- With all Crypto rising $MARA can also mine other coins if it makes sense, they have pivoted before to coins providing better financial value.  
\- Saylor just tweeted ""$MARA is a company on the #Bitcoin Standard."" We have Daddy's approval üòè  
¬†\---

ü§ìNumbers

I had break my üö´ no math on weekends rule to write this, ain't it sad?

I am only going to go over $MARA compared to $MSTR, they have the most bitcoins and $MSTR is $MARA's biggest competitor. Numbers are from Nov 21st, assume a $BTC value of 98k. Premium calculations are taken from u/Jazzlike_Record_8915 on Reddit, they obviously fluctuate daily but I am just using them to illustrate a point.

While the value of $MSTR is derived 99% from its $BTC holdings essentially making it just a proxy, $MARA has an operational business valued at $3B so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per Bitcoin.

Holdings Value (Bitcoin):  
\- $MARA $3.191B - $MSTR $32.457B  
¬†  
Gross Equity (Operating Company Value):  
\- $MARA $6.391B - $MSTR $32.957B  
¬†  
Net Equity (After Debt):  
\- $MARA $4.972B - $MSTR 24B  
¬†  
Market Cap:  
\- $MARA $7.92B - $MSTR $117B  
¬†  
Premium per share:  
\- $MARA 1.59x - $MSTR 4.87x  
¬†  
Implied price per $BTC  
\- $MARA $156k - $MSTR $477k

ü§î 156k vs 477k per $BTC

Ahaaaaahh! Do you like paying a 3x higher premium? I mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy Fred, over at Marathon Digital Holdings, he's putting his business to work.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone üå±

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.  
\---

üìäTechnical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on üêÇish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è at calling movement before it happens.  
[https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518](https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518)  
In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.

üòÆ‚Äçüí®Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now ü•µ

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh ü´µüßê  
\---

‚úäHow to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- üíéBuy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- üí∞Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- üíµBuy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- ü§°Wait until its too late.

As the value of the company‚Äôs bitcoins skyrocketed, the overall company value is now 99% based on the bitcoin value and less than 1% on the software part.  The company now borrows heavily based on their value and uses the borrowed money to buy more bitcoins.  MSTR stock has jumped from $100 in Sept to $500 on the prospect of their bitcoins being worth more.  \n\nMarathon Digital MARA is a company that started as data center using their servers to generate bitcoins.  They look for cheap sources of electricity to make this more cost efficient.  MARA has had ups and downs with their bitcoin generation business.  OP suggests they are now profitable and that they too are using the MSTR model of buying bitcoins, not just generating them.\n\nOP contends that MARAs core business of generating bitcoins is worth $3 billion and the bitcoins they own are worth $3 billion.  So it‚Äôs more of a 50/50 core business to bitcoin holdings split than MSTR‚Äôs 99/1 split.  \n\nOP notes that even without buying any bitcoins, MARA‚Äôs data centers will generate 8600 extra coins per year.  MARA has 30,000 coins, so generate 8600 more would be an extra 20%.\n\nOP also points out MARA can flip their servers to generate which type of crypto coin is the best value at any give time.\n\nBacking out MSTR and MARA‚Äôs debt that they‚Äôre each using to purchase more bitcoins, MSTR is valued at about 3x per bitcoin what MARA is.\n\nOP extrapolates that to give themselves a one year MARA PT of $120, versus today‚Äôs $25.  \n\nOP is assuming bitcoin can only go up.\n\nMy own observation is that a strategy of buying the same exact product you‚Äôre simultaneously trying to sell to others is the opposite of hedging.
