      "Body: RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,\" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. \"This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. \"Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \\*far less\\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \\*one drop\\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \\~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.\n",

A 1-2x per week use can bring their tolerance up to 100mg per dose pretty easily and all of the sudden you need an entire chocolate bar for one \"session\".

      "Comments: ['If you\\'re familiar with Harry Browne\\'s Permanent Portfolio, you know the entire idea is to match the performance of the market with a lower Sharpe ratio. By losing very little principal during drawdowns, it avoids the \"[volatility tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax)\" that crushes your long-term CAGR. In its original 1999 incarnation, the portfolio was divided according to this rubric:\\n\\n* 25% equities (can be represented by SPY)\\n* 25% long-term bonds (can be represented by TLT)\\n* 25% gold (can be represented by GLD)\\n* 25% cash (can be represented by SHY or a savings account)\\n\\nRay Dalio\\'s twist on it during the 2000s was to apply external leverage to juice returns. The original\\'s Sharpe ratio was 0.6 and Dalio pushed it back up to 1, accruing better ROI with the same volatility as SPY. Recently Porter Stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities. The actual details behind his version are too long for this post, but the idea of internal leverage^1 to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind. \\n\\nFor the last six months I\\'ve been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown. The key word here is *converted*: I was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with non-linear returns on short notice. During period of crisis for the bond market, long-term securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up. In such instances you are stuck with a \"risk free\" asset that\\'s rapidly depreciating in value. Simultaneously I wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the Sharpe ratio - it forces your CAGR to converge with the general market during good times. We want a setup that outperforms when the market\\'s hot and offers better principal protection when it\\'s cold. \\n\\nAfter doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of May, I arrived at the following portfolio:\\n\\n* 30% equities, replacing SPY with high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria.\\n* 30% gold and other precious/industrial metals, leveraged through exposure to high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria. \\n* 20% income option strategies. They are characterized by a high win rate (ideally 75% and above), high profit factors, uniform application across equities, and a focus on frontrunning institutional moves based on taking advantage of *their* long-term strategies for generating wealth. We would use the Kelly Criterion to determine allocation and guard against disproportionate losses. These replace bonds entirely. \\n* 20% cash, preferably in a MMF or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation. \\n\\nThe big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options. It probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative, but that\\'s due to retail primarily using options for speculation. They don\\'t employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk. Yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow.^2 All of them are based on exploiting how money flows through the structure of the market, not whether an individual stock/ETF will directionally move in our favor. The tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return, and the risk can be ameliorated.  \\n\\nThe arguments in favor of options over bonds are the following: \\n\\n* In theory, you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless. In reality, it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital. Unless you\\'re running a 0DTE, you should never lose more than 25-30% before hitting the stop loss. \\n* Since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions, they are agnostic to the state of the market. It doesn\\'t matter if it is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways period. By contrast bonds rely on a disinflationary/deflationary environment to appreciate in value. In inflationary environments, bonds are doubly penalized: you lose on real yield returns and the underlying value is crushed as rates are hiked.\\n* As these income option contracts are primarily short duration, the cash from premiums + returns can be invested into longer-dated puts during market corrections. At the bottom of bear markets, the cash flow can be diverted into equities.\\n* Repeatable options strategies are not that rare. For example, there is a multi-leg setup that has a historical win rate of 90% with an average 20% return per winning transaction and a 17:1 profit factor. When we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week, you will generate roughly 600% return on that investment over 40 weeks. The general loss when it fails is 5-10% with an occasional dip below 20%. There are strategies based on gamma exposure, anchored VWAP on stocks with strong upwards/downward momentum, 0DTE credit spreads, selling contracts on blue-chips during periods of momentary weakness, etc. that succeed 80-95% of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters. The biggest obstacle to success is maintaining the discipline to avoid exposure to big losses. \\n* As a corollary to 3 and 4, the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low Sharpe ratio. The returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis, which gives you the flexibility to rebalance portfolio distribution based on the state of the market. \\n* The majority of principal dedicated to options is never in play at any particular point. It is technically cash until it\\'s tied up into contracts - the wagered amount is sized according to the Kelly Criterion. In practice you\\'ll have 35-40% of the portfolio in cash. While the inherent risk is higher for options than bonds, the overall risk to the portfolio is lower in the face of secular economic changes.\\n\\nThis is not a gameplan for passive investors. It requires a moderate amount of oversight. \\n\\n^1 The difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns. External leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt. This debt is independent of the investment\\'s mechanics, such as a margin account. Internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset, treating the security as a second order derivative. Think of junior miners that go up 500%, 1000%, 5000% during a gold bull market. The key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility, using a combination of allocation size and selecting capital-efficient proxies with good management. Leveraged ETFs are not considered.\\n\\n^2 Bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable, predictable behavior from the former. In the case of the U.S. government, the holder assumes the government is both solvent and willing to fulfill their obligations. Guess what that also describes? An options contract. The difference is you, as a holder, are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control 80-85% of all transaction volume. In the aggregate they exhibit formulaic actions when rebalancing their portfolios, protecting their downside, and so on that is easily exploitable. It\\'s this feature, not a promise to pay interest, that generates long-term cash flow.', 'Lots of these comments read like late 2021.', 'Citadel buys (a lot of) Intel stock, trims (a lot of) NVDA.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCrazy? 🤣']\n",

      "Its GMS increased from \\~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.\n",

      "\n",
      "“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. \n",

      "As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. \n",

      "**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected.

      "Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.\n",
      "\n",
      "The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.\n",

Also the float is so tiny they can dilute public shareholders at any time.', 'United’s standards keep falling every year. Every manager was supposed to fix United and bring back to its past glory.\\n\\nLet them finish in top 4 first and then dream about the other scenario.', \"Ten Hag had such a similar record prior to taking over Utd to Amorim, in a similar level league. So its not clear if Amorim can be the silver bullet. Utd don't even have marketable players anymore like Ronaldo, Pogba, Lingard and Rashford seems to be on his way out. I walk into sport shops now in Ireland and Man City jersies are on sale, and you dont see Utd jersies anymore, especially amongst the children.\\n\\n\\nThere is also going to be a redevelopment of their ground and they'll have to deploy capital there instead of signings in the medium term.\"]\n",

While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.\n",

      "Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.\n",

      "Body: Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  \n",
      "*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share\n",
      "\n",
      "This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "End of 2020: *$1.12*  \n",
      "2021: *$0.80*  \n",
      "2022: *$0.92*  \n",
      "*2*023: *$1.04*  \n",
      "LTM: *$1.19* \n",
      "\n",
      "Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:\n",
      "\n",
      "A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue\n",
      "\n",
      "B) a steadily increasing margin, and\n",
      "\n",
      "C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time\n",
      "\n",
      "We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble\n",
      "\n",
      "*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*\n",
      "\n",
      "This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. \n",
      "\n",
      "On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. \n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. \n",
      "\n",
      "As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* \n",
      "\n",
      "All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.\n",

      "Happy investing!\n",

      "Body: UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)\n",
      "Comments: [\"Somewhere in the middle.  Autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off. When that happens, Uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but that's fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own. Uber can also clean/fix self driving cars, but that (which would require stations scattered all around) is a whole other business vs an asset light app.  Some talk that Uber was interested in EXPE and perhaps it tries to diversify (travel super app.)\\n\\nSo I think somewhere in the middle. I don't think Uber goes away by any means, but I can see Uber looking different/very different 5-10 years from now. Self-driving on a massive scale is still a long ways off, but I do think that it'll probably continue to be a cloud over Uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 5-10+ years from now. On the very short term, stock is getting close to oversold.\", \"Waymo has a partnership agreement using the Uber platform. Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of Waymo's vehicles in selected major cities.\", \"They have partnership with Waymo, Cruise and other small providers and even if self driving has mass adoption Tesla will not be the only player, it's a matter of time they try to operate on their own and find out it's a pain in the ass and would partner with Uber to dispatch, maintain and also support the rides...it's way to complicated to replicate Uber and operations whether Its self driving or human driven.\"]\n",

      "Body: I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.\n",
      "2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.\n",
      "3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me that there are the following risks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.\n",
      "2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.\n",
      "3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.\n",
      "4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.\n",

      "I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.\n",

      "As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Valuation Concerns:**  \n",
      "Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Slowing Growth:**  \n",
      "While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  \n",
      "Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Increasing Competition:**  \n",
      "The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  \n",
      "The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Profitability Concerns:**  \n",
      "While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Bearish Trend:**  \n",
      "The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  \n",
      "The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a \"death cross.\" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Resistance Levels:**  \n",
      "ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  \n",
      "The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Volume Analysis:**  \n",
      "Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risks to Short Thesis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  \n",
      "Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  \n",
      "A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Margin Improvement:**  \n",
      "If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**  \n",
      "While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.\n",

      "Body: I’m back with the RedCat DD that I promised. \n",
      "\n",
      "RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the “reigning champion” from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and “competent” near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh it’s one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. \n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here’s a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don’t you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic, you’re right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I’m sure you’re losing focus but I’m certain your wife’s boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18’s? How about raising taxes and buying both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. \n",
      "\n",
      "In case you aren’t aware, the US Army is America’s largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they’ll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. \n",

      "\n",
      "That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America’s military industrial complex wants on hand?

      "Body: **Alright everbody, let’s talk about where we’re at with ACHR:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here’s a look at what’s been happening. We’ve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  \n",
      "Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**381 Funds are on Board**  \n",
      "Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions—up 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer’s growth. Big money sees the potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  \n",
      "Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.\n",
      "* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This aligns with the momentum we’ve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn’t just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Major NYC News**  \n",
      "Archer’s partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  \n",
      "Archer’s plans go beyond the U.S., they’re actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.\n",
      "2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.\n",
      "3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.\n",
      "\n",
      "India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer’s biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  \n",
      "Archer’s new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Journey Continues**  \n",
      "For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it’s not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren’t guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there’s no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn’t over yet, join if you’re ready to see what’s next. 🚀\n",

      "Body: Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \\~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...\n",
      "\n",
      "1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.\n",
      "2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.\n",
      "3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.\n",

      "\n",
      ">We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 1: The Listing**\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is this important?\n",
      "\n",
      "Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \\~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.\n",
      "2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares\n",
      "3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**\n",
      "\n",
      "2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)\n",
      "\n",
      "The process was straightforward:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest\n",
      "2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services\n",
      "3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)\n",
      "\n",
      "And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 3: The Next Frontier**\n",
      "\n",
      "To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \\~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.\n",

Mara Holdings last week completed a $1B convertible note offering, raising $980M of proceeds, and after using $199M of those proceeds to repurchase $222M of principal of its 2026 convertible notes, it has $781M of proceeds, which management will use to buy Bitcoin, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Cantor believes Mara is taking a page from MicroStrategy’s () playbook, which is to utilize the capital markets for the purpose of buying Bitcoin, though it differs in that it has a core business that mines Bitcoin, and it is the largest publicly-traded  miner when it comes to hash rate. The firm sees Mara’s mining business becoming more accretive in the future.”\n",

Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212.

      "I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to strategic growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 1-2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.\n",

      "Extreme heat that damages crops in Southern Brazil (where the citrus belt is located) is almost always is accompanied by El Niño. El Niño occurs when the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm, causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others. La Niña is the opposite pattern, where the same region of the Pacific becomes cooler than normal, also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions. These patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently, based on its geographical location. For Brazil, and the citrus belt in particular, El Niño is the more serious problem, because El Niño generally brings heat while La Niña takes it away.\n",

      "Heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering Brazil's citrus production in the 2022-2023 growing season (CitrusBR). This means that as long as we don't see another very strong El Niño in the near future, we can be assured of successful orange harvests in Brazil. Based on historical data (Fig 7), the Niño index seems to follow a normal distribution, with La Niña usually following strong El Niños. Given the fact that we just had a very strong El Niño in 2023, there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years.\n",

I’ve joined call out groups twice in the past, but was lost between the lingo and how fast everything was moving. Now I am going to learn to trade on my own. My current plan is to start with ~$500 and focus on ETF options (SPY, QQQ, IWM), though I will also keep my eyes open for news and catalyst plays that I have the buying power for. I am going to use price action and full timeframe continuity to look for openings, as that is what I currently know and research other strategies as I go. I am also researching tools this time around because I’ve had trouble with order blocks and resting liquidity in the past which would have gave me better insight into how price might react to hitting a level. My current risk management strategy is limit entries to 20% of my portfolio with a 20% loss tolerance/stop loss (I will likely be focusing on IWM while I build my account), limiting my losses to 4% per entry. My plan is to lower the entry limit as my account grows but increase my loss tolerance per entry to maybe 35%. I will be using a cash account to avoid bitting off more than I can chew and margin interest cutting into potential profits.\n",

      "\n",
      "The \"MaraStrategy\" (codename: 💊) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.\n",

Without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways. Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation.

Chew on this, $BTC has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen $MSTR has been outperforming a majority of companies, less than a year ago it was valued at less than 10B now its valued 10x higher at nearly 100B, they have 33B in $BTC alone.
