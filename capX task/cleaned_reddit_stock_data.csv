   reuters aggregated  global news



most fundamentals are updated every  months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports

expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well

but growth stocks dont rely so much on eps or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count  going from  million to  million subscribers means more revenue in the future

value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both eps  revenue  youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never invest in a company solely for its dividend


see the following word cloud and click through for the wiki

market cap  shares outstanding  volume  dividend  eps  pe ratio  eps qq  peg  sales qq  return on assets roa  return on equity roe  beta  sma  quarterly earnings

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","teslas electric vehicles likely would not qualify for californias new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if presidentelect donald trump scraps the federal tax credit for ev purchases governor gavin newsoms office said on monday
tesla shares closed down 

trumps transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of  for ev purchases reuters reported this month

tesla ceo elon musk a close trump adviser sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from ev subsidies writing on x in response even though tesla is the only company who manufactures their evs in california this is insane

musk has said he supports ending subsidies for evs oil and gas

newsom said on monday that if trump eliminates a federal ev tax credit he will propose creating a new version of the states clean vehicle rebate program that ended in  and spent  billion to subsidize more than  vehicles

the governors proposal for zev rebates and any potential market cap is subject to negotiation with the legislature any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition innovation and to support new market entrants the office said

california provided up to  for the purchase or lease of a new plugin hybrid battery or fuel cell ev and could potentially be paid for by the greenhouse gas reduction fund which is funded by polluters under the states capandtrade program

musk and newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting teslas fremont factory during the pandemic and californias approval of a bill on transgender kids

in  tesla moved its headquarters from california to texas and musk said this year that his other companies such as spacex and social media platform x will follow suit

california has crossed the  million mark for sales of zeroemission vehicles doubling total sales since 

last month a california official said he expects the environmental protection agency to approve the states plan to halt the sale of gasolineonly vehicles by  a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism
californias rules which have been adopted by a dozen other states require  of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by  and no more than  plugin hybrid electric

blocking transactions with bitcoin vendors profits from bitcoin have also been heavily taxed buying microstrategy lets retail get exposure to bitcoin without much hassle and more importantly buy it on isa anyone can open an isa and load it up with shares worth up to k a year with isa you dont pay tax on any dividends from shares and you dont pay capital gains tax on any profits made from the investments\n\nso microstrategy to many feels like a way to rip off shortterm taxfree profit if btc goes up during this cycle', 'there is a deep confusion everywhere online about this stock at the moment\n\nis mstr is levered bitcoin\n\nemphatically no it is not not since several years ago it has approximate numbers a b market cap and has b of btc it trades at a x premium to its nav that is the opposite of levered btc for every  of mstr you buy your btc exposure is literally  you dont get more than  of exposure you get significantly less\n\nwhy is it moving like levered btc then\n\nmstrs moves are a truly astonishing phenomenon in our markets today up there in the annals of history with stock movements such as gme in jan  there are a number of reasons why it is moving like this including\n\n   catalysts such as the mstr btc yield saylors big btc buys and trump winning put mstr on a lot of peoples radar and the buying started \n   leveraged funds such as mstx and mstu own over b of exposure mstr and have to buy a lot on up days and they contribute to the runaway rally if mstr is up  on the day these two funds together will have to buy b of mstr which is  of the company note that most stocks dont even have  of their shares trade in a day\n   various short sellers and call sellers have been hurt by certain initial moves and have had to close pushing the rally even further see for example the rthetagang guy\n   various hedge funds were short mstr and long btc because it was trading at a premium of x nav and that premium kept increasing causing people to have to close their books at a massive loss\n\nthis list is by no means exhaustive please add any other reasons you can think of below\n\n\nthe magnitude of the mstr moves and the current premium it trades at

microstrategy work to deflate it on a bitcoin price break  seems very risky', 'it holds so much btc that if us takes the position to add a reserve of btc it will skyrocket like a vicious cycle its just leveraged btc the unique thing about the stock is that it is actively using financial tools to serve its own value its a bet on btc pretty much but mstr is only accumulative for btc they arent selling any of their holdings they arent actively trading btc back and forth just absorbing more they buy whether btc is flat lowering raising in value \n\nmost people that invest in it are anticipating that btc will be more valuable than it is today its overweight today but mstr is still buying more btc secretly behind the scenes by the time it gets announced publically the price is sometimes locked in at a average cost of k per btc cheaper \n\nim not really invested in it but it seems like its like investing in a conveyer belt of btc rather than just a sterile flat static purchase of btc\n\nthe key question is how does mstr differ from a btc etf and the answer to its value will be there', 'at some point retail buyers will run out of money thats why whats happening now will eventually no longer work', 'mstr is taking advantage of the financial system of using leverage for another growing digital asset whats wrong with that', 'its a ponzi scheme', 'if youre bullish

my question is how is it that most years ecopetrol stays profitable when it costs them  more to breakeven they have been profitable most years and still gain lots of venue how can petrobas not just lower prices remain profitable and chase them out what is keeping ecopetrol around in this situation","['how is it that most years ecopetrol stays profitable when it costs them  more to breakeven\n\nwhat theyre selling oil it doesnt matter if your breakeven is bbl or bbl as long as oil is trading for higher than bbl which it is both will be profitable\n\nhow can petrobas not just lower prices\n\nwhy would they who in their right mind would sell oil gas and refinery products for less than market prices just because im confused it wouldnt impact other oil producers anyway because market prices are a function of supply and demand and supply doesnt change just because petrobras sells for less', 'maybe ecopetrol has less execs addicted to coke', 'they are government owned they arent going anywhere\n\nimo there are way better investments than a stateowned latam oil company even in the energy sector north american oil companies are probably the better buy for the long run', 'so asking for advice on how to profit off the demise of your own species \n\nbold move']",11,1732549863.0
Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"for those who were sleepingpartying on the weekend the following happened

 doj said google should divest off chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
 prohibited from acquiring any interests in search rivals potential entrants and rival search or search adsrelated ai products
 halt all anticompetitive payments to distributors including apple samsung so that google isnt the default search engine on their devices
 content creators can choose to optout of google crawlers to train its ai

most obvious historical comparison is case against microsoft corp in  the doj tried to split microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on windows though this case ultimately resulted in a settlement with that in mind it is possible the doj will go this way this time

 search is close to  revenue of google q results
 browsers market shares chrome  safari  edge  source can be contested because its larger devices stats only
 android   market share in handheld devices

goog has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic it may have a few options up its sleeves





chrome as a standalone listed company like opera browserpossibly the worst move average user unlikely to install a browseronly app than stick with factory default browser on the device 
chromegemini as a new company to command an ai valuationnot likely to attract advertisers until this new app gets wild chatgpt like popularity 
androidchrome as a new company provides operating system for device manufacturerswont make sense because samsung already has their prop version of android and to gain search traffic google again needs to partner with this new company which is prohibited
a company with personal suite of applications gmail calendar docs and chrome bundled togetherchrome then gets s million users from day still above legal prohibition remains 
settlementmake it all go away

any other speculations with so much uncertainty the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias until theres clarity on the case

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"i think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity with one exception and almost no one knows why because the precise nature of how thc as a drug operates isnt well understood by people who arent both habitual consumers and uptodate with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so

its the following issue lets say its  when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and i want to get high i light up a single  joint with my friend we smoke for  minutes and then were giggling we go to buy some twice a month or so a few years later its been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds to draw customers to them get market share and so on buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as x that amount of the neighboring places stuff

this is a race to the bottom soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff but you need far less of it to get the same high habitual users spend less than  of what they used to on weed now everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition in addition you now have hash oil edibles dab pens tinctures you name it not just regular flower

i never smoked much anyway but in the rare case i want a minivacation now i can take a vial of tincture and put one drop under my tongue within two hours the world is spinning its so strong i never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month a single bottle of this costs about  and it comfortably lasts me an entire year this is a disaster for the industry because i almost never need to give them business its so strong that i rarely need to make a purchase at all and no need for all the paraphernalia with it either no vapes pipes lighters etc the bottle comes with an eyedropper even if i use it often and develop a high tolerance i still rarely need to go out for more my friend and i have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for th the price we can get the same high now assuming one of us has a tincture or dab vape pen or edible or a newly exotic and potent strain at home

compare this with alcohol where you cant make say vodka much stronger than it is its impossible for me to come up with a x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because its physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than  i think and vodka is already around  and cant reasonably go much higher taste etc also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc

or cigarettes where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant zyn use the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery you cant just get a years supply of nicotine in a bottle because first of all itd be fatal with a slight dosage error you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every  hours regardless of how much youre used to consuming assuming youre dependent on it to begin with of course and so it is a consistent business for sellers this is most true of cigarettes but also applies to vapes and pouches which have similarly excellent profit margins all of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product

the only exception to this turning point brands tpb stock because they dont sell weed they sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff actual weed sellers do not because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased thc concentration in the products you cant sell th as much paper to people for the same effect or at least its less affected by this issue the company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something not sure how thatll work out keep in mind this is a small cap company less than  billion in market cap reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector but its one small and thriving business i can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely not sure how much more it can grow its probably overvalued now but in the past year or so its risen strongly

Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"i find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals

 cash flow per share growth year over year
 net profit margin growth year over year
 lower longterm debt year over year

but also has

 lower revenue year over year
 lower net income year over year
 lower earnings per share year over year

in my opinion when revenue or net income is declining and not flat or increasing it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn especially in a continued pattern of these results

however i often see companies with these symptoms sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year however the chart is very bullish at times

thoughts thanks in advance for your opinion

Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"a few months ago i posted about games workshop and why i thought it was undervalued

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"does anyone have any insight into delaware funds managed by macquarie 

unfortunately i was persuaded to purchase into one of the small  mid cap mutual funds in december  obviously the market was on a bit of a run there but everything about the fund historical build up morningstar ratings length of existence of the fund recommendations by publications yoy performance  etc led me to believe it was a reasonable if somewhat more aggressive investment  

it was all well and good for about a year as the market rebounded from covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy   articles like this in the mainstream press lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism 

and then it did a capital gains distribution historically very normal for this fund in december  and then the share price immediately started its plummet  like overnight lost share  similarly it went seemingly overnight from a morningstar  rating to a  rating  it continued to fall from there 

  
i guess i am one of those silly buy and hold people  i always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term  since thenno 

  
earlier this year delaware merged a couple of their funds so dfdix became iymix   as far as i can tell the holdings in iymix are not radically different than what dfdix held   in a market that has been turbo charged for the past year the growths of this fund have been glacial   i realize that the holdings are small  mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost 

ive literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me  plenty have not grown in dramatic ways but actually halving of value  thats never happened before 

does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small  midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive 

  
im a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in vanguard or something but its been really stressful  

thanks in advance  and yes i realize i should have been using trailing stops but didnt so no lectures there please","['i always assume short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term \n\n to  is not longterm thats shortterm  years is longterm investing \n\njust cutting losses and investing in vanguard\n\nyou could easily have losses in any vanguard fund over any  year period', 'small caps do not always move in lockstep with large caps although they are somewhat correlated you cannot compare the two asset classes as if they are the same also everything lost money in  thats not atypical for any fund', 'and yes i realize i should have been using trailing stops but didnt so no lectures there please\n\ncant use stops with a mutual fund \n\nin a market that has been turbo charged for the past year the growths of this fund have been glacial\n\nlooking at the fund on morningstar iymix has been basically sort of middle of the peer group over the longterm and is towards the bottom ytd not the worst fund but nothing noteworthy at all either theres definitely better actively managed offerings', 'depending on losses it may be better to cut your losses and move into a popular index fund if the increased returns can make up the shortfall you can also claim the losses on taxs to offset', 'and then it did a capital gains distribution historically very normal for this fund in december  and then the share price immediately started its plummet like overnight lost share\n\nwas your distribution  per share']",10,1732381515.0

entire idea is to match the performance of the market with a lower sharpe ratio by losing very little principal during drawdowns it avoids the volatility tax that crushes your longterm cagr in its original  incarnation the portfolio was divided according to this rubric\n\n  equities can be represented by spy\n  longterm bonds can be represented by tlt\n  gold can be represented by gld\n  cash can be represented by shy or a savings account\n\nray dalios twist on it during the s was to apply external leverage to juice returns the originals sharpe ratio was  and dalio pushed it back up to  accruing better roi with the same volatility as spy recently porter stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities the actual details behind his version are too long for this post but the idea of internal leverage to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind \n\nfor the last six months ive been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown the key word here is converted i was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with nonlinear returns on short notice during period of crisis for the bond market longterm securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up in such instances you are stuck with a risk free asset thats rapidly depreciating in value simultaneously i wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the sharpe ratio  it forces your cagr to converge with the general market during good times we want a setup that outperforms when the markets hot and offers better principal protection when its cold \n\nafter doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of may i arrived at the following portfolio\n\n  equities replacing spy with highquality companies adhering to strict criteria\n  gold and other preciousindustrial metals leveraged through exposure to highquality companies adhering to strict criteria \n  income option strategies they are characterized by a high win rate ideally  and above high profit factors uniform application across equities and a focus on frontrunning institutional moves based on taking advantage of their longterm strategies for generating wealth we would use the kelly criterion to determine allocation and guard against disproportionate losses these replace bonds entirely \n  cash preferably in a mmf or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation \n\nthe big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options it probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative but thats due to retail primarily using options for speculation they dont employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow all of them are based on exploiting how money flows through the structure of the market not whether an individual stocketf will directionally move in our favor the tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return and the risk can be ameliorated  \n\nthe arguments in favor of options over bonds are the following \n\n in theory you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless in reality it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital unless youre running a dte you should never lose more than  before hitting the stop loss \n since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions they are agnostic to the state of the market it doesnt matter if it is in a bullish bearish or sideways period by contrast bonds rely on a disinflationarydeflationary environment to appreciate in value in inflationary environments bonds are doubly penalized you lose on real yield returns and the underlying value is crushed as rates are hiked\n as these income option contracts are primarily short duration the cash from premiums  returns can be invested into longerdated puts during market corrections at the bottom of bear markets the cash flow can be diverted into equities\n repeatable options strategies are not that rare for example there is a multileg setup that has a historical win rate of  with an average  return per winning transaction and a  profit factor when we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week you will generate roughly  return on that investment over  weeks the general loss when it fails is  with an occasional dip below  there are strategies based on gamma exposure anchored vwap on stocks with strong upwardsdownward momentum dte credit spreads selling contracts on bluechips during periods of momentary weakness etc that succeed  of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters the biggest obstacle to success is maintaining the discipline to avoid exposure to big losses \n as a corollary to  and  the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low sharpe ratio the returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis which gives you the flexibility to rebalance portfolio distribution based on the state of the market \n the majority of principal dedicated to options is never in play at any particular point it is technically cash until its tied up into contracts  the wagered amount is sized according to the kelly criterion in practice youll have  of the portfolio in cash while the inherent risk is higher for options than bonds the overall risk to the portfolio is lower in the face of secular economic changes\n\nthis is not a gameplan for passive investors it requires a moderate amount of oversight \n\n the difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns external leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt this debt is independent of the investments mechanics such as a margin account internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset treating the security as a second order derivative think of junior miners that go up    during a gold bull market the key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility using a combination of allocation size and selecting capitalefficient proxies with good management leveraged etfs are not considered\n\n bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable predictable behavior from the former in the case of the us government the holder assumes the government is both solvent and willing to fulfill their obligations guess what that also describes an options contract the difference is you as a holder are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control  of all transaction volume in the aggregate they exhibit formulaic actions when rebalancing their portfolios protecting their downside and so on that is easily exploitable its this feature not a promise to pay interest that

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"i have been a long term investor in mstr in fact buying  my position presplit  
my thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into bitcoin  even though i have btc as a holding in my crypto i was more after exposure in an equity portfolio

to cut a long story short i bought it when it was no mainstream and no etfs were existing

i must admit i sat on a loss for about one year in mstr  buying at  split adjusted and for the longest time sitting at the  range btc was consolidating and i was fine with that

if people understand what mstr are doing this playbook with bonds and hedging btc was already in play for a long time i was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early  the difference being now that btc is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well the eyes on mstr has multiplied exponentially 

fast forward one year and and the fomo crowd arrived and with that volatility

here is what i learnt when the fomo arrived

 the stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation
 valuations do not matter anymore  the premium on btc was as low as  less than one year go reaching a peak earlier this week at 
 the stock goes up like crazy and comes down like crazy and when this happens its time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control
 there is so much manipulation eg the citron report social media mainstream coverage on what a damn tweet  it is not really easy to understand how this will move so at this point it is just gambling

i held my position up to the  level and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the  level  so after  years i am out of the mstr trade

the lesson i learnt is when the crowds arrive turn round and walk away

i still believe in the mstr playbook but will only come back when i am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when i am in a bidding war with gamblers","['so from  to

Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"i went into rocket lab back in july with the intention of making it my primary longterm growth stock and since then have managed to acquire  shares at average price of around   

my intention wasis to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years because i truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and i believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the us i am not american btw

just before the election i was in profit in the low thousands which was nice but since the election i am now sitting at a profit of  which is my best position in my investing career so far 

like i said i believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power however given the fast rise since the election i am expecting correction happening soon 

and my dilemma is should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction or should i just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"obviously a lot of money is being made off of airelated stocks im not one of those lucky investors part of the reason is that i fear were not in a general ai bubble as many have discussed but rather a generative ai bubble id appreciate hearing how others feel about this

right now by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative ai especially llms with nvda at or very near the center of it all thanks to its gpus meanwhile alternative ai approaches eg neuromorphic computing symbolic ai reinforcement learning and hybrid models have been getting far less attention

the problem as impressive as it may seem generative ai has some significant and inherent drawbacks

 factually unreliable outputs it cant reliably distinguish fact from fiction
 probabilistic reasoning no true causal understanding
 high computational costs questionable sustainability
 limited realworld problemsolving abilities

at some point the reality of generative ais limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an ai market correction or even collapse this would not only hurt ai stocks like nvda but it could also starve funding for alternative ai approaches that have longterm potential yet have been largely overlooked

what do you think how is this influencing your investment decisions","['you missed out the fact that generative ai is essentially a logarithmic function as well that means exponential increases in model size are needed for incremental improvements in functionality rapidly approaching a limit\n\nthe alternative models are all pretty theoretical at the moment afaik\n\nits not influenced my investing decisions at all though', 'yes very few ai companies are actually turning a profit except the ones that are selling shovels to other ai companies\n\nthe big thing to look out for is increased capex and therefore depreciation at large tech companies this will lead to slowing earnings growth which in turn can hurt valuations but due to the nature of accounting it will take time to show up', 'i think you might be overestimating the importance of these drawbacks\n\nfactually unreliable outputs it cant reliably distinguish fact from fiction\n\nthis can be greatly improved with rag and instituting some degree of redundant qa or human in the loops for mission critical applications truth is most applications can tolerate some degree of error as well since humans generally arent perfect either\n\nprobabilistic reasoning no true causal understanding\n\nthe actuarial sciences would like to have a word with you here\n\n\nhigh computational costs questionable sustainability\n\ngenerally the trendline has pointed towards the opposite with per token costs rapidly declining\n\n\nlimited realworld problemsolving abilities\n\nreasoning models are rapidly addressing this and in the meantime there room to instruct relavent real world understanding during ai agent orchestration it does require going a step deeper that entering a prompt into chatgpt

have to be  factually correct  of the time to be economically useful and it is getting better at this over time\n\n\nit just has to be better than the average human which i would argue it already is in a lot of important ways\n\n\ncomputational costs will be less than human equivalent models are getting smarter and smaller and more energy efficient each month it takes ai  second to write a software program that would have taken me hours\n\n\nreal world problem solving capabilities are just getting started because llms currently produce text on the internet and this doesnt easily move atoms around in the real world\xa0', 'id be more concerned with what the vision is for what llms are good for so far their most prominent applications are a providing much worse customer service in

totally waste of time generic crap with almost zero value add regurgitates what it can scrape from the internet with dubious audit control even that is less than  of the effort so really isnt much of

can have an incredibly detailed discussion about the realities of ai and you might be entirely right however i think it really becomes the very simple question of what stops the spending you have a

would rather overspend then lose \n\nvrt is up  ytd but what stops the spending on data centers a recession doesnt seem like theres one in the nearterm \n\ndo people eventually come to the conclusion that ai doesnt have the capabilities they hoped forwere sold on it eventually having if thats the case how long are people willing to wait before coming to that conclusion might be longer than anyone

inconsistencies in your train of thought and i bet chatgpts output will be better in terms of reasoning building up the structure and focusing on the right discussion points and not drift away in some esoteric new theoretical models which do not add anything to the debate you actual point is what if transformers do not scale because there is no new ai tech on the horizon which could come anywhere

DOJ calls for Google to divest Chrome in antitrust push,"the department of justice doj is pushing for significant changes to google goog googl including a divestment of its chrome browser following an august court ruling that found the company had illegally monopolized the search market

yahoo finances senior legal reporter alexis keenan joins morning brief cohosts brad smith and seana smith to discuss what this means for google and its parent company alphabet  
  
keenan notes that while google has opposed the dojs proposals calling them a radical agenda that could harm consumers and the tech industry the case becomes more complicated with the upcoming administration change

in my opinion googl shares are extremely undervalued and this situation will resolve itself once trump takes control my advice buy","['why is the stock down today given the news was leaked on tuesday and the report was available yesterday', 'wonder how this will even play out if the current doj will be replaced in two months anyways', 'people working at the doj  ', 'i bought more its heavily undervalued just dcaing', 'ok so in other words its early black friday', 'what a dumb remedyits not even a remedy chromium is the source of both chrome and edge it is an opensource product this will change nothing it also shows that the doj is clueless in this matter', 'if alphabet were split into separate companiesyoutube search waymo healthcare etcthe combined value would likely exceed its current valuation google is trading at a pe ratio of  with a forward pe of  which is remarkably low especially when you compare it to tesla valued at  trillion despite generating just  billion in revenue', 'if the doj is about fairness and equality they should also force microsoft to sell edge and apple to sell safari also if google isnt allowed to be the default search engine then do the same for all browsers pop up a choice of search engines to select from or let the user decide on something else if its not listed', 'can someone explain why search is a monopoly as opposed to just a popular product there are alternatives out there but most people choose to use search because its widely regarded as better also microsoft have railroaded me to use bing more than google ever have search', 'i thought that the doj would just make google stop paying apple to be the default search engine and have them pay a fine instead they want them to completely divest from chrome which is definitely interesting', 'these viscid lawyers should be forced to use bing everyday for the rest of their life', 'if this was the only bad news around google would people sell\n\ni mean if google announces it stops supporting chrome would this really hurt their business more than the layoffs would save\n\nfrom my perspective the browser business used to be an unprofitable way to lure people into the google ecosystem but now for google its nothing more than an expensive hedge\n\nas a web developer google to me has always been a pioneer and advocate for an open web and web technologies even as more and more people shy away from the browser the way i see it if theyre forced to exit this market itll simply hurt this market not them', 'this is just the biden administration bringing out all the existing cases to public so that the next trump administration have a harder time closing them they want to put it in public before the heads of prosecution teams are kicked out  \n\ni expect more doj activity in coming days', 'same story as usual retail panic sell on garbage clickbait news will be back to s in next days if not even in after hours', 'can someone please help me understand the impact of this divestment it does not sound like a big deal at all', 'so doj is done with going after trump and now decide to pick on google just great', 'is this doj even gonna be around in a

what happens to whoever buys chrome are they targeted next just an endless circlejerk', 'how does this make sense  chrome is a free product  google spends a lot of money maintaining the software so the browser itself is a money loser  how does a buyer make money with it  the equivalent is firefox which relies on handouts from google and the organization still cannot keep its head above water',

"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 22, 2024","this is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme

   reuters aggregated  global news



most fundamentals are updated every  months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports

expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well

but growth stocks dont rely so much on eps or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count  going from  million to  million subscribers means more revenue in the future

value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both eps  revenue  youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never invest in a company solely for its dividend

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"intuit shares fell  in extended trading thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts estimates due to some sales being delayed

heres how the company performed in comparison with lseg consensus

earnings per share  adjusted vs  expected

revenue  billion vs  billion

revenue increased  year over year in the quarter which ended oct  according to a statement net income fell to  million or  cents per share from  million or  cents per share a year ago

while results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates secondquarter guidance was light intuit said it anticipates a singledigit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the turbotax desktop software in retail environments while that will affect revenue timing it wont have any impact on the full  fiscal year

intuit called for secondquarter earnings of  to  per share with  billion to  billion in revenue the consensus from lseg was  per share and  billion in revenue

for the full year intuit expects  to  in adjusted earnings per share on  billion to  billion in revenue that implies revenue growth of between  and  analysts polled by lseg were looking for  in adjusted earnings per share and  billion in revenue

revenue from intuits global business solutions group came in at  billion in the first quarter the figure was up  and in line with estimates according to streetaccount formerly known as the small business and selfemployed segment the group includes mailchimp quickbooks small business financing and merchant payment processing

we are seeing good progress serving midmarket customers in mailchimp but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers sandeep aujla intuits finance chief said on a conference call with analysts we are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve firsttime use and customer retention

better outcomes are a few quarters away aujla said

creditkarma revenue came in at  million above streetaccounts  million consensus

at thursdays close intuit shares were up about  so far in  while the sp  has gained almost  in the same period

goodarzi said on cnbc that hes personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration

on the earnings call goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy

our belief which is not baked into our guidance is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in  particularly just with some of the things that i mentioned earlier around just interest rates jobs the regulatory environment he said these things have a real burden on businesses and we believe that a better future is to come

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral," introduction

etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in ecommerce and ill argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral

the idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmadevintage goods is amazing and theres no doubt that there is demand for it

any marketplace has two important metrics

 the gross merchandise value also known as gmv represents the value of all products sold through the website etsy decided to use gross merchandise sales gms which is just a different term
 the takerate represents their share of the gms

its gms increased from  billion in  prior to the pandemic to  billion in  however since then etsy has experienced a decline and the gms in  was  billion the lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace

 the real problem

the company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers and together they paint quite a picture

the number of active sellers continued to grow from  to  it increased from  million to  million

the number of buyers has been flat

economics teaches us a simple lesson if the demand is stable and there is an increase in supply the prices will decrease

economics also teaches that lower prices would attract more buyers increasing the demand

so where are the buyers

as etsy doesnt and cannot check the quality of all the products more and more aigenerated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market heres a comment from a reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development

dropshipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces i used to adore etsy when it first started but now its just absolute garbage you have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure its the real deal and actually handmade this recently happened to me when i was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group turned out it was a scam using a real artisans pictures to sell their cheap shit thankfully i was able to rectify the issue but it was a hustle

the us sellers used to contribute over  of etsys revenue a decade ago now its down to 

ill argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm etsy in the long run with the events being

 increase in lowvalue products on etsy
 the lowvalue products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the highvalue products as they are cheaper
 the sellers of highvalue products will sell fewer products and some of them will eventually leave etsy
 the buyers will be disappointed by the lowvalue products and will not use etsy as much or at all

 what is etsy doing

etsy is spending  of its revenue on marketing vs  a decade ago and has even engaged in tv ads to raise awareness and bring new customers

over the last few years the company has been spending m per year only to keep the revenue flat it is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed and the strategy is to replace them with new ones

 the takerate

the only other way for etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its takerate and its share of the gms

the company splits its revenue into two groups

 marketplace revenue  of total  these are required fees that cannot be avoided transaction fees payment processing fees listing fees
 service revenue  of total  these are optional such as onsite advertising shipping labels etc

its takerate is incredibly high at  double from a decade ago for comparison ebays take rate is 

 terrible management decisions

as the company was reaching its peak the management decided to make  large acquisitions

 reverb aug th   a marketplace for new used and vintage music gear was acquired for  million
 elo  july nd   also known as the etsy of brazil a brazilbased marketplace for unique handmade items was acquired for  million
 depop july th   a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for  billion

it is important to note that depop had an annual revenue of  million no this is not a typo etsy paid over x its revenue to acquire depop

well not that long later in q the company recorded impairment charges of over  billion for depop and elo no better way to destroy shareholders value quickly than by overpaying for an acquisition

a year later in q elo was sold at a loss

 historical financial performance

historically this is still an impressive growth its revenue grew from  million a decade ago to  billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at 

its operating margin is lingering around  now as both marketing  product development as  of revenue have been increasing the increase in marketing expense as  of revenue has already been highlighted in a previous section it is necessary to maintain the buyers base so potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general  administrative as  of revenue

 valuation

the two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are

 revenue  given that the number of active buyers hasnt grown in the last few years it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation
 operating margin  i do think theres room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general  administrative as  of revenue my assumption is that that it will increase to  over time

based on my input the fair value of the company is  billion share this is significantly lower than the current market cap of  billion share

anyone betting on etsy is ultimately betting that

 the number of lowvalue products will decrease over time
 the number of buyers will start growing again
 etsy can continue increasing its takerate without losing sellers of highvalue products
 the management will not engage in acquisition as they are clearly bad at it

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at gap during its fiscal third quarter but the apparel company still posted betterthanexpected results leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year 

gap which runs old navy banana republic athleta and its namesake banner is now expecting fiscal  sales to be up between  and  compared with previous guidance of up slightly thats ahead of the  growth that lseg analysts had expected and bodes well for the allimportant holiday shopping season which is now underway 

the company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected

shares surged about  in extended trading

heres how the nations largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what wall street was anticipating based on a survey of analysts by lseg

 earnings per share  cents vs  cents expected
 revenue  billion vs  billion expected

gaps reported net income for the threemonth period that ended nov  was  million or  cents per share compared with  million or  cents per share a year earlier 

sales rose to  billion up about  from  billion a year earlier

across gaps business unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about  percentage point during the quarter while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by  ceo richard dickson told cnbc in an interview 

we had unusual circumstances hurricanes storms that led to almost  closures at the peak of the impact said dickson adding the storms affected old navy gaps largest brand by revenue the most 

as soon as the weather turned around sales rebounded and the holiday shopping season is off to a strong start so far said dickson 

we are energized about the holiday our teams are really focused on executing our plans if we compare ourselves to where we were last year our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year he said weve got stronger brand identities and were more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about driving better product better pricing more relevance better consumer experience and excellence in execution 

since dickson took the helm of gap a little over a year ago hes worked to turn around the business after years of declines under his direction the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row but the company is still smaller than it once was and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive fullprice selling

heres a closer look at each brands performance 

old navy gap said sales at its largest brand grew  to  billion while comparable sales were flat shy of the  growth that analysts had expected according to streetaccount old navys kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather said dickson 

gap gaps eponymous banner grew  to  million during the quarter while comparable sales were up   better than the  growth wall street expected according to streetaccount the brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product the company said 

banana republic the trendy workwear line grew sales  to  million while comparable sales fell  a bit worse than the  drop that streetaccount had expected the brand has worked to turn around its mens business which drove results during the quarter overall it is still focused on fixing the fundamentals the company said 

athleta the athleisure arm of gaps empire grew sales by  to  million while comparable sales were up  the results werent comparable to estimates in the yearago period comparable sales were down  at athleta under its new ceo former alo yoga boss chris blakeslee the brand has managed to turn things around

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"according to forbes magazine manchester united is the second most valuable club in football only behind real madrid only real madrid and barcelona have more fans in the world this is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is premier league in   this was the last season with sir alex ferguson at the helm  he is the best manager in history of this club he retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming last season they finished th in the premier league this season they are th disappointment they play in europa league second tier competition in europe the real money is in champions league

they have a tremendous potential big history a lot of fans a lot of money they should compete for the most important throphies every year but they didnt in previous years and fans are angry about that

things are subject to change though at the end of  sir james ratcliffe bought  of clubs shares he is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run he is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to on january  omar berrada was appointed as new ceo of the club chief executive officer he joined united after  years spent in manchester city that was the most successful club in england during this period on july  dan ashworth started to work as sporting director he worked for newcastle and brighton previously he did a really god job there in brighton under his watch they transferred in caicedo mac allister cucurella mitoma and trossard they sold them later for more money in newcastle he was in charged when they bought isak gordon barnes tonali and botman great business recently they hired ruben amorim who was successful in sporting lisboa in the summer he was considered as new liverpool fc manager eventually they decided to go with arne slot who is excellent in his new role

the future for manchester united is bright they have a competent people running the club ruben amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like jurgen klopp did it at liverpool in the last decade he needs time but he seems to be capable of making manchester united great again they were underperforming in the last  years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better they need a time of course to build strong team the thing is  if they perform on the pitch they earn more money i believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top and when they reach this level when they compete amongst really the best their stock price should be much higher than it is now

i think they will be a strong again very soon they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club the next  years should be much better than the last  years currently their stock price is  usd they certainly has potential for more one more reason is  there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock

i think that this club will compete for premier league and champions league in  years and it should have a huge impact on their finances my opinion is this stock has potential to grow am i wrong what do you think i am new in the stock market so maybe i am missing something","['the club has been one of the worst managed in europe for over a decade also the float is so tiny they can dilute public shareholders at any time', 'uniteds standards keep falling every year every manager was supposed to fix united and bring back to its past glory\n\nlet them finish in top  first and then dream about the other scenario', 'ten hag had such a similar record prior to taking over utd to amorim in a similar level league so its not clear if amorim can be the silver bullet utd dont even have marketable players anymore like ronaldo pogba lingard and rashford seems to be on his way out i walk into sport shops now in ireland and man city jersies are on sale and you dont see utd jersies anymore especially amongst the children\n\n\nthere is also going to be a redevelopment of their ground and theyll have to deploy capital there instead of signings in the medium term', 'oh were really just throwing crap at the wall and hoping it sticks now', 'not one single mention of anything financial related', 'the club is still valued in the billions and have a rabid fan base even tho they have been terrible in recent years the previous owners glazers were terrible but spend money tickets prices are crazy but always sell out and most of the money they make these days are from apparel \n\ni havent looked at sport teams that are listed never dawned on me but if the price is right could be a decent investment if they can turn things around this club is too big not too just need some direction and a plan going forward\n\nedit new owner', 'public sports teams see years of sum of the parts stories about msg often seem cheap and will likely trade at some degree of discount vs comparables until they are either bought or there is some other sort of significant attempt to monetize assets in some way msg breaking into sphr msgs and msge although im sure some people can probably make the case the parts  and particularly the sports teams wmsgs  are still some degree of undervalued based on comparables\n\nthere have been multiple rumorsstories over the years that someone was going to buy manu but none of them have happened you have a stock that went public  years ago and is up  anyone whos a fan probably enjoys owning a piece of the team but its not been a very good investment if the team gets better the stock might be somewhat better going forward but i still think you are going to be able to find better investments elsewhere than an improved manu i just dont think that theres much interest in public sports teams unless people think that theres some chance of buyout', 'only own it if your a  supporter  period  and only  share', 'worthless analysis football clubs are inherently a terrible investment due to the massive salaries that they pay players most of the revenue comes from sponsorship deals who can absolutely lowball you if your team is consistently losing']",0,1732310301.0
"Palo Alto Networks beats Q1 estimates, shares fall as billings decline. BOD approves 2-1 stock split.","

for the quarter ended october  palo alto networks reported adjusted earnings per share of  versus the consensus estimate of  revenue totaled b versus the estimate of b

for the quarter in progress palo alto networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from  to  with a midpoint that matches the estimate its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from b to b which represents  growth year over year the midpoint of b comes in just above the estimate of b   

second quarter nextgeneration security arr is expected to range from b to b which would represent a yearoveryear increase of 

total revenue for fiscal year  which runs from august  through july  is expected to range from b to b this would represent  growth year over year

the board of directors also approved a twoforone stock split which will increase the number of authorized common shares from b to b trading on a splitadjusted basis is expected to begin on dec  

ive been a big fan of panw for the last  years while the billings decline isnt great its been expected as the company pushes for platformization i anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook but short term may seem like growth is slowing platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because theyll be integrated across the business across multiple levels

although im a big fan of the stock i will admit its an expensive one a lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth i think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels im not in cybersecurity so im not sure the likelihood of that but id keep an eye on it ive made several posts about panw over the last year and my consensus is i will continue to buy monthly and if theres a large pull back down to  ill look to make a large purchase with cash reserves","['i\nit was a good q dont understand the problem nikesh will take panw to b fcf and it will be a b stock if it dips too much just buy', 'its simple buy what pelosi buy and she buys panw', 'now  green', 'didnt they have  stock split like  years ago', 'tall stick networks']",61,1732197326.0
Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"indias adani group saw shares of its companies plunge thursday after its billionaire chairman gautam adani was indicted in a new york federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation

the yearold billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over  million in bribes to indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than  billion in profits

the indian groups flagship firm adani enterprises fell  while the company in the eye of the storm adani green energy tanked  adani energy fell  

adani power lost  adani ports share price dropped  while the groups retail arm adani wilmar shed 

the benchmark nse nifty  index slid  in its first hour of trade

adani along with two executives from adani green energy limited  his nephew sagar adani and vneet jaain  have been charged with misleading us and international investors about the companys adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over  billion to finance energy projects

the fivecount indictment in us district court in brooklyn also accused ranjit gupta and rupesh agarwal former executives of the renewable energy firm azure power global along with three former employees of the canadian institutional investor caisse de depot et placement du quebec  saurabh agarwal cyril cabanes and deepak malhotra

cdpq said it is aware of the charges filed those employees were all terminated in  and cdpq is cooperating with us authorities the investor said in an email

this comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and brazen stock manipulation made by shortseller firm hindenburg research 

since releasing our january  report identifying adani as the largest corporate con in history we have never wavered in our view nor has adani ever refuted our findings hindenburg said in a statement to cnbc on thursday

the conglomerate had rebutted the claims adding that it has always been in compliance with all laws

these charges do not change the strong underlying fundamentals of indias market or the countrys growth trajectory said raymond james head of advisory solutions and market strategy matt orton

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"let me preface this by saying i live in europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to us markets due to higher historical returns

this in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the spnasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in europe so do any american guys look at european markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the eu markets 

theres an argument to be made that potentially investing into eu serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to us markets but i find it very hard to find good european companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity slower growth more regulation and government oversight 

personally the three companies i still have in my portfolio in the eu markets is rr nvo and lvmh lvmh is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to china additionally nvo is listed on nyse and had uptil recently performed rather well

so finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the american markets for european ones or actively increasing their allocation if so would love to know the rationale and more importantly any particular industries or geographies that youre targeting ","['im german and the only german stocks id consider would be rheinmetall  y and sap ', 'no  us\n\nrationale being i like money', 'a lot

less tax on profits at every level from the company itself to the most retail of investors so you get more back from every dollar you put in even if the company is absolutely identical\n\n\n

Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"over the past few years ive built a portfolio consisting of sp apple meta amazon microsoft jpm and brk it has done rather well consistently giving returns of  annually except  

however in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned i just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade

i could  be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will

so saying all this im considering 

 sp

 hood

 rddt

 rolls royce

 cava

 lunr

 asts

quick rationale for each

hood expanding to europe and offering very exciting new products like hood gold 

rddt fastest growing social media arpu and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

rolls royce slight european exposure building low cost nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

cava fantastic management strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next  years

lunr  asts moonshot literally this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

"Target shares plunge 20% after discounter cuts forecast, posts biggest earnings miss in two years","target on wednesday missed wall streets quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and posted only a slight uptick in customer traffic despite the discounters price cuts on thousands of items and its early holiday sale

need help seems like target is always empty with no cashiers went to barnes and noble two days ago and spent  minutes trying to find a book because i couldnt find someone to help me feels like its

lost ground to walmart walmart is a literal one stop shop target is fun but is not a grocery store for most americans and walmart has gained ground with more affluent shoppers which ironically target has abandoned those people in hopes to bring in a value guest but their focus on value is so dramatic  and its only rooted in poorly constructed private label its almost as if theyve eliminated a lot of mainstream brands in lieu of their own i think theyve lost their way and no longer have an identity and walmart is making genuine strides in technology supply chain and infrastructure while target

Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"firstly apologies for my english its not my first language

my stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against asml after the last earnings report the following are the ones i am aware of

  bronstein gewirtz  grossman llc  
the complaint alleges asml misrepresentet or failed to disclose that  the issues being faced by suppliers like asml in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than asml had indicated to investors  the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicy acknowledged  asml had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology

  glancy prongay  murray llp

the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false andor misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the companys business operation and prospects

  law offices of howard g smith

have also done the same with similar allegations raised against asml now it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one ive never really assumed there was any misleading being done sometimes you raise guidance sometimes you lower guidance 

  
i assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits but ive not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites i follow which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal i am however not very knowledgeable on american law regarding these kinds of lawsuits

The Bullish case for OPRA,"with google under pressure from the doj this looks like a huge potential for opera if google was forced to sell chrome this would give smaller browsers like opera a great chance to gain some market share also when you look at browsers excluding edge and firefox opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison they are also one of the only browser stocks that there are at least the only one of any substance 



on the flip side even if google isnt forced to sell chrome then we should see the momentum continue for goog

ive been a long term holder of opra for this very reason they have a steady growing base of m users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies ive always looked at opra as a hedge against goog at least as far as their browser is concerned it also pays to hold because they have a great divided

ive been a long term holder of goog too though i think both are great companies but im buying both to more or less hedge my bets

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"after some research i really beleive this stock is gold

viking therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for vk at obesityweek

subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to  from baseline and  placeboadjusted weight loss after  days of daily dosing at  mg as far as i am concerned i believe this is more effective than mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately  of starting body weight after  weeks of treatment 

also oral vk demonstrated a favorable safety profile with  of adverse events classified as mild or moderate the oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience 

lets look at subcutaneous vk resultor like doses weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to  from baseline up to  of treated patients achieved  weight loss compared to  for placebo weight loss was progressive throughout the study with no plateau at  weeks

the obesity drug market is projected to grow to  billion by  offering significant upside for vk this is also important because at this size of a market it can hold many or multiple big players analysts also predict viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline this would boost the price up to  digits

whats more the company also received praise for its liver disease treatment vk which showed positive results in a phase b trial for mash metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis a serious liver condition affecting  million americans reductions in liver fat ranging from  to  at  weeks with response rates  reduction as high as  far exceed typical benchmarks 

the clinical data reinforce vks potential as a bestinclass obesity treatment with effective weight loss strong safety and durability of results the only reason why the stock hasnt skyrocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of rfk junior and as far as im concerned diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation ive seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad ","['nothing you mentioned suggests that the company is making any money or will make any money\n\nedit they are in fact losing money\n\nand dont ignore the fact that insurance companies are dropping coverage for weight loss drugs', 'the time to buy was  years ago when it was trading around  \n\nnow i think you missed the boat \n\nand tbh i think it already peaked last year', 'meh  mounjaro real world results is about  wt loss', 'to understand why vktx is such a no brainer buy you need some knowledge of biotech stocks others people on here will just look at financials and think losing money  dont buy\n\nthey dont know vktx is waiting for an acquisition \nthey dont know vktx has superior efficacy and safety compared to all other oral glpgip drugs in development including nvo and lly', 'im loaded to this tits on this stock very very very bullish rumor is that they will be announcing a manufacturing partner sometime in the next month with multiple tons of capacity that should demolish any short thesis left the experts all say the same thing about best in class data only a matter of time until the market catches up', 'adding more on the next gap fill to  and amgen about drop some bombs soon mari tide data', 'its not scalable  the cost to mass produce and market the wonder drug is too expensive for it to make it profitable the drug can be great in clinical studies but that does not mean it willcan be mass produced at a price tag to take shares away from market leaders like nova elly', 'agreed on all fronts\xa0', 'so you an insider or what quit wasting our time and tell us lol']",0,1732236473.0

recent deal at her company from a phone call with his wife  they will look at any perfectly timed trades after the fact then they go in and find evidence  they look at perfectly timed trades with news it is a hazard because all of sudden the sec gets to look at some of the best trades and has the justification to figure out their trading strategy in a case and can obtain the data and everything just because it is perfectly timed', 'when paul pelosi bought a shit ton of nvidia calls days before the chips act was to pass then abruptly sold it all after they got hammered with criticism  yeah that was blatant and obvious insider trading and that shit should have been investigated', 'ive worked in brokerages in london back in the s up until  and never saw a hint of insider training was

convicted for a b violation insider trading posting this older comment  write up i had saved down from some long deleted account\n\nthere is a serious legal bar between difficult to find and nonpublic nonpublic implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private such as what officers of a corporation might have they are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic lets illustrate this with a few examples\n\nif an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the companys upcoming earnings and the executive answers  honestly  without suggesting a quid pro quo and  without requiring a promise of confidentiality and nonuse from the analyst then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain because legally the executive has effectively made this information public there is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact but thats really an edge case and isnt relevant here\n\nif i am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work i discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract and i lead the way to securing that contract for my company then  it is illegal for me to trade my own companys stock in response i am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship but  it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company because i have no confidentiality relationship with them assuming my employer doesnt restrict this which they might  read your ndas carefully\n\nif your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them and youve been all over the country and draw certain wellfounded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things yes you are allowed to trade on that data legally again in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not which establishes confidentiality if your company is set to profit from this no you cant trade your own companys stock  that generally constitutes illegal inside trading\n\nif i am sitting in a starbucks and i overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging and this information has not yet been released to the public i am allowed to trade on this information the information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery conversely if i see them in the starbucks and bribe them for

extremely widely misunderstood it is so misunderstood and so nuanced that matt levine a columnist at bloomberg who writes money stuff has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","qualcomm said on tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional  billion per year by 

of that amount roughly  billion will come from pc chips qualcomm said at its investor day on tuesday the chipmaker just introduced pc processors earlier this year when it released snapdragon x for windows devices

the latest forecast marks an important milestone for qualcomm ceo cristiano amon who took over the company in  with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones in fiscal  qualcomms handset business reported  billion in sales about  of its entire chip business

qualcomm also said on tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about  by  to  billion of which  is tied to contracts that have already been secured

we have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile amon said at the investor event

another  billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and  billion will come from chips for headsets a category qualcomm calls xr about  billion of the forecast is a catchall for other chip sales like those for wireless headphones and tablets

qualcomm shares are up  this year trailing the nasdaq which has gained 

qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for highend smartphones especially those running google android qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to apple for its iphones

but the company has warned investors that apple could choose to stop buying qualcomm parts as soon as  qualcomm said on tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from apple

qualcomms strategy under amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips like modems processors and ai accelerators in new markets including cars pcs and virtual reality the investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as  billion

we put a strategy in  and were not changing our strategy amon said

laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by intel which has over  percent of the market according to mercury research intel reported  billion in pc chip sales in its 

the competitive landscape changed between the windows and macs amon said referring to apples move in  to switch from intel to its own processors we saw that as an opportunity especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution

the forecast for xr headsets also hints at the growth potential of the vr market over the next five years qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers including meta for its quest and raybans products

when it comes to artificial intelligence qualcomm calls itself an edge ai company in contrast to cloudbased ai thats typically powered by nvidia processors company officials didnt rule out introducing data center products in an interview with cnbc

qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced ai thats restricted to large server farms today an indication that that company may benefit from the ai boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient

"Exciting times for space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks!","space nuclear and quantum computing stocks are ripping and roaring there are lot of small to mid cap companies in these industries that could one day be mega cap companies  picking the correct ones is the hard part 

would love to hear everyones favorite companies in these three sectors supported by a little explanation as to why you think they have a bright future 

i am particularly excited about these three industries because i believe the number of satellites in orbit will grow significantly in the next  years i am optimistic that smr nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years and i believe quantum computing is finally here and real world applications are popping up every day 

my personal picks for these three categories are rdw oklo and ionq let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options i have a small stake in all three 

apreciate the responses

people in the telecommunications industry and they see this apples intrusion into their territory as the biggest existential threat in their  years of operation \n\nlunr is still relatively cheap compared to the others who have several billion market valuations the thing about lunr is not their moon landers theyre aiming to be a space communications company by building a constellation around the moon and will likely expand outward over the next decade or two\n\ni am sour on asts and rklb chances asts ran up based on assumptions and analysts reports before the appleglobalstar deal was announced and before the election results where musk will muscle starlink into ubiquity and can afford to undercut them on price until theyre out of business they still need to raise billions to support  satellites or however many they need tim farrar a respectable communications guru believes theyll eventually go bankrupt as mnos start to bail on them\n\nrklb is an interesting case its being

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","hello friends i hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday this is a long analysis with a position at the end i will discuss palantir and its recent explosion in share price as well as their current earnings multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value i recognize that this is r investing and thus short selling is not within everyones risk profile i hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir

so heres something you may have read somewhere palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy right since  this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason im not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right they showed strong revenue growth increasing margins they turned gaap profitable last year a major milestone and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward it is obviously a company that for the right price you want to be a part of

key phrase for the right price i am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation but i would like to make a case for palantir being overvalued in fact the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated palantirs stock is

for starters lets take into consideration palantirs enterprise value despite the stock price rising roughly  versus its  peak palantirs enterprise value has ballooned much more

 peak enterprise value b at around  per share  
 enterprise value b at around  per share

this is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding in december  palantir had m shares outstanding this has risen to  billion as of their most recent filing while palantirs growth has certainly been impressive it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count their revenue per share metrics have been the following

end of    
   
   
   
ltm  

palantir has only recently recaptured its revenuepershare number that it had by the end of  this is not necessarily a bad thing but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived growth stock yes revenue is increasing  but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase as a shareholder your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth

likewise their profitability can also paint a distorted picture palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings if it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture you better believe karp  co will do so many of palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the nongaap numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag but one of the most overlooked aspects i found is that of interest income palantir has a massive cash balance gained through dilution  shocker i know that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income this is of course nothing new lots of companies do this 

but consider this in their last blowout quarter palantir gained  of gaap eps this amounts to roughly m of net income or about th of their enterprise value of this number m or more than one third was interest income this is not a small footnote only m of their last quarterly earnings was actual nonadjusted nononsense operating income furthermore they also paid only m of taxes on their income this number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate 

and then there is the valuation palantir trades at x ev  sales this means that if all of palantirs revenue was aftertax profits and paid out as dividends it would at their current revenues take until  until investors recoup their investments their current ebit margin is a little over  that x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require

a incredible and sustained growth in revenue

b a steadily increasing margin and

c an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

we all remember stock mcnealys sun microsystems ceo iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

at  times revenues to give you a year payback i have to pay you  of revenues for  straight years in dividends that assumes i can get that by my shareholders that assumes i have zero cost of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company that assumes zero expenses which is really hard with  employees that assumes i pay no taxes which is very hard and that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal and that assumes with zero rd for the next  years i can maintain the current revenue run rate now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at  do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are you dont need any transparency you dont need any footnotes what were you thinking

this is somethine else entirely  times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well remember you still need upside its not just about justifying the current stock price its about penciling out enough upside in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time 

on friday the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year tesla bitcoin and palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise palantir added  and with this move added another five years of revenue to its elephantsized market cap this shows pretty clearly that palantir is associated with memelike risk assets who knows when the current market cap will reverse its a game of liquidity musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing but one thing is clear their current ev  ebitda is nearly x 

the amount of retail shareholders i see online that are convinced that this will go to  amazes me my question is why based on what sure it shoots up  a day and this leads everyone to believe its an amazing company but longterm this company has enormous shoes to fill it is currently a penny masquerading as a  bill palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due and unless these guys accelerate their growth to  annually for a decade and increase their margins to nvidia levels there is only one way this ride will end 

as it stands now all of palantirs equity is in the b cash position that they gained through dilution last quarter the company earned  of gaap eps of which  was interest income and only  was operating income aside from the  of equity per share all of palantirs  share price is based on this  of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this in the future growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep rd of gaap eps in interest income their taxes will also go up in the future if this is not a dotcomlevel valuation i do not know what is 

if you currently buy a  year bond you will net roughly  in interest annually palantirs stock nets you   in revenue 

all of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity thus i am short for now using graniteshares x palantir spa the leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time thus i will look to acquire longdated puts this week could get smoked some more but thats what makes a market

happy investing","['palantir has been funny to watch when it was under  reddit hated it and didnt wanna touch it i made some decent small money trading some calls wish i had held longer after selling

not really a clear target to the downside though maybe  but look how much easier this was for the people on the upside all you have to do is throw a rock at the chart and hold on for you to make money

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?",uber uber technologies has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that donald trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the united states easier to get through presumed from his newfound friendship with elon musk now relatively obviously uber sold off quite a bit on this news but i believe this isnt as bad as the market is making it out to be i believe that uber could easily survive mass adoptions of autonomous vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for uber and see their expenses come down greatly as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers uber currently sits at  fcf yield  if you factor in sbc and is growing fcfs at over a  ytd and revenue  ytd this is a rapidly growing company thats priced quite cheaply and i believe that the downfall of uber is greatly exagerated if uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with waymo to be the platform provider i think theyre positioned very well for the adoption of autonomous vehicles would love to hear everybodys thoughts i own no position in uber but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices,"['somewhere in the middle  autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off when that happens uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but thats fragile and

asset light app  some talk that uber was interested in expe and perhaps it tries to diversify travel super app\n\nso i think somewhere in the middle i dont think uber goes away by any means but i can see uber looking differentvery different  years from now selfdriving on a massive scale is still a long ways off but i do think that itll probably continue to be a cloud over uber unless they can

Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"i recently have started using sgov in my brokerage as a savings account which i pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts  the returns are between  in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my high yield savings account hysa so i basically have discontinued using my hysa and just use sgov  i dont think i fully understand the risk after talking to a schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight  for comparison here are  different yet similar investment vehicles that i am comparing

 sgov an etf that is  invested in ultra short term treasuries  day yield of   high liquidity as i can instantly buysell during market hours  share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends  interest is  tax free at the state level due to treasury holdings
 mm swsbx a schwab money market account  day yield of   schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at  per share uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events  higher liquidity as money settles in  hrs  interest is paid directly to the account  interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings
 hysa a high yield savings account  day yield of   bank acts as a middle man with my money investing it in treasuries and bonds and paying me a return  benefit fdic insurance  drawback slow liquidity if i need to move money around quickly  interest is subject to state and federal taxes

the schwab advisor was trying to say that sgov is not negligible risk because it is an etf so supplydemand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like sp  he said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price  google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market so this already seems wrong  i have noticed certain days ill have a small  loss although it does provide the anticipated day yield over the course of the month  i assumed these minor losses were from buyingselling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals  weeks vs  week etc

it seems to me that there are the following risks

 government  treasury insolvency if something like this happens it seems that all  of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as fdic insurance so im not really concerned about this
 etf management fraud this seems like the main risk if the sgov board was committing fraud and not actually allocating  of its resources to treasuries  the risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to sgov
 return rate fluctuation  if federal interest rates suddenly drop it seems all  vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others  therefore im not really concerned about this either  this also would only impact future returns not your principle
 black swan event  if something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred what would happen  would sgov plummet mm be protected through schwab backing and hysa be unaffected and protected with fdic  this is my primary concern

tldr  is it possible for sgov return a negative value  i understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle","['good questions i also use sgov to store my collateral for csps right now so im curious to check back for answers\xa0', 'always very short term risk with them if the rates suddenly go up early in the month that means the bond they bought at say   could be bought at say a price of  because of a fed hike for example then the present value of those bonds could drop over  suddenly they will still go up the   by the end of the month but you are open to a rare and short term price drop especially early in the month', 'risk because it is an etf so supplydemand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like sp\n\netfs are structured to have creation units which allow institutions to buy or sell blocks of the funds securities to arbitrage any difference to nav  this forces the price to stay close to the nav  one sided buying or selling the etf will not drive the price of an etf like it would a stock \n\netf management fraud\n\nthis is why funds have custodians and auditors  a registered fund cant do a bernie madoff and lie about its holdings because there are third parties verifying them\n\nblack swan event\n\ntreasuries are what investors would run towards in a financial crisis so sgov should do fine']",13,1732057887.0

Trading SPY for gains,"first time posting long time lurking

i had some money k only sitting at a hysa and earning  interest
decided to buy k spy and harvest profit on a day to day basis meaning if stock goes up i withdraw gains if it goes down i do nothing

my hys was returning  per month i made  in  days and kept k on spy

what am i missing here even if i stop now and dont sell for the whole month i still did better than hysa 

are there tax implications or complications for realizing lots of micro short term gains 
i believe the tax bracket of hysa and short term gains is the same 
will my tax be too complicated to file if i keep doing these micro profit withdrawals

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"

  
tsla  overnight due to this news

  
bloomberg  members of presidentelect donald trumps transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully selfdriving vehicles one of the transportation departments priorities according to people familiar with the matter

if new rules enable cars without human controls that would directly benefit elon musk the tesla inc chief executive officer and trump megadonor who has become a powerful fixture in the presidentelects inner circle he has bet the future of the ev maker on selfdriving technology and artificial intelligence

current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities which tesla plans to do the trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate selfdriving vehicles according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they werent authorized to speak publicly

while the transportation department through the national highway traffic safety administration can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles an act of congress would clear the way for mass adoption of selfdriving cars a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around avs two of the people said

one candidate under consideration for transportation secretary is emil michael a former uber technologies inc executive who has spoken with trumps team and potential staffers they said the work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined they said 

republican representatives sam graves of missouri and garret graves of louisiana have also been considered to lead the department the people said

the transition team didnt respond to requests for comment

musk in october announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in  current us regulations pose significant hurdles to musks plans for the socalled cybercab including a cap limiting their deployment 

he supported federal rules for autonomy on teslas thirdquarter earnings call saying hed use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide the pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of uber and rival lyft inc

trump has since named musk and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy to lead a new department of government efficiency initiative to dismantle government bureaucracy and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome

past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled

nhtsa currently permits manufacturers to deploy  selfdriving vehicles per year under a granted exemption but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as  have repeatedly failed

a bill to do that sailed through the house several years ago during trumps first term but the measure has been bogged down in the senate an attempt during the first year of the biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming classaction cases","['hi youre on rstocks please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being offtopicpolitical feel free to edit it now and be more specific\n\nto everyone commenting  please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being offtopicpolitical\n\nif youre interested in just politics see our wiki on relevant subreddits and post to those reddit communities instead without linking back here thanks\n\ni am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorstocks if you have any questions or concerns', 'how can manufacturers with a straight face say consumers shouldnt be able to sue them\n\nin this case their car drives on its own so they have to be completely on the hook for any damages caused by the car if a car self driving car requires me to be liable or requires my own insurance then it is not a self driving car\n\nit will be fun trying to avoid accidents with these unregulated self driving cars', 'lol we are just crash test dummies', 'anything they put on the road should not only be safe under various driving conditions but also needs to be safe from hackers\xa0\n\n\nrushing to put these out on the road is setting up for a series of dangerous events i honestly think these can be safe in the long run but bypassing safety will sabotage the advancement of this industry', 'this is what  million buys', 'is this becoming similar to boeing approving its own new type of airplanes of course this in teslas and musk short term interest', 'if there are no regulatory barriers left what excuse will musk use for missing launch dates', 'removed', 'aur  pre market\n\nedit now ', 'so i guess they are not even going to try to pretend to be independent and no just self serving huh thanks america', 'robotaxi anyone whats a few dead people among friends ', 'removed', 'i dont get why people think current rules are what is stopping tesla there are already other manufacturers with self driving cars on the road with the exact same rules', 'ahhhh is this what leave the world behind was about', 'expect a lot of insurance fraud', 'would this be the equivalent of the hospital making you sign a waiver before a risky procedure to cover their ass in case the surgery goes wrong', 'musk is killing the competition after killing the ev subsidy and now changes the rules to have more of his cars on the street very efficient indeed', 'hopefully they put these self driving vehicles in alabama', 'trump team  elon musk your evs can and will fall apart years earlier than ice vehicles and you will like it', 'my tslt about to rip above ', 'might be disagreement but i think full self driving cars will never coexist amongst human driven cars \n\ni think if full self driving does ever happen it will start out with fully self driving areas and then expand over time as more people buy cars with the tech', 'i thought rstocks believe tesla fsd is so bad and waymo is the true leader in self driving \n\nso they should be celebrating this development because waymo can be deployed in all  states all at once instead of undergoing  different set of rules under each jurisdiction \n\nbut keep complaining because its obvious you do not have first hand experience in fsd  in hw  cars', 'i love my tesla stock euphoric this past week\xa0']",276,1731903761.0

my due diligence  research for mcdonalds corporation mcd



 fundamental analysis

a valuation

 pricetoearnings pe ratio currently at x which is higher than the industry average of x suggesting potential overvaluation

 pricetosales ps ratio at x significantly higher than the industry average of x indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales



b revenue growth

 the company faces increasing competition from fastcasual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices



c margin pressure

 rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on mcdonalds profit margins

 the companys operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years suggesting limited ability to improve profitability



d debt levels

 mcdonalds has a high debttoequity ratio of  which is significantly above the industry average of 

 this high leverage increases the companys financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns



e market saturation

 mcdonalds has limited room for expansion in developed markets where it already has a significant presence

 growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences



 technical analysis

a trend analysis

 the stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period potentially setting up for a reversal

 the day moving average is showing signs of flattening which could indicate a loss of momentum



b relative strength index rsi

 the rsi is currently near overbought territory above  suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback



c volume analysis

 recent trading volume has been below average indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend



d support and resistance

conclusion



there are several factors  mentioned above that suggest mcdonalds stock mcd could be a potential short candidate



 the stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics

 the company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion

 high debt levels increase financial risk

 limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets

 technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum



however its important to note that mcdonalds is a wellestablished company with a strong brand and global presence short positions carry inherent risks and any trading decision should be made in the context of a welldiversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance

mcdonalds is ramping its ai efforts back up and all signs point to soundhound ai as their next major partner their recent job posting for a director of ai engineering focuses on integrating generative ai genai and large language models llms into existing systems rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch this aligns perfectly with soundhounds expertise in conversational ai and their dominance in the foodservice sector notably mcdonalds previously ended its ai collaboration with ibm leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drivethru kiosk and mobile ordering systems

adding fuel to the speculation soundhound recently announced on their earnings call that theyve secured a major new client in the restaurant industryone they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others given mcdonalds history of partnering with established tech leaders like dynamic yield and the timing of this hiring its hard not to connect the dots if this is indeed a mcdonalds x soundhound collaboration it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cuttingedge conversational ai im expecting an announcement in the next month on who the new logo is and i think its pretty likely the largest name in the industry","['ive only ever seen people on reddit shit on soun which is enough to make it a strong buy for me', 'i used to think soundhound was just a crappy company that rode the ai wave now i look at their partnerships and theyre with a lot of the big car guys most restaurants with their yum partnership and it seems like theyre seeing success with the restaurantservice industry definitely a stock to look at', 'never heard of the firm what is an existing use case']",20,1731942329.0

BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"let me first talk about the biontechs q  financial results and some key intepretations i had

there are some notable short term challenges including

    decreased revenues from covid vaccines
       for the nine months ended september   revenues were  billion down from  billion in the same period in 
    net losses due to high rd spending
       the company achieved a net profit of  million in q  compared to  million in q  however for the first nine months of  biontech reported a net loss of  million a significant decrease from the  million net profit in the same period last year
    uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals
       fda placed a partial clinical hold on the phase  nsclc trial due to varying results
       the partial fda clinical hold on bntonc and the covidinfluenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges

now there are many long term potencials

 a robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in latestage trials
    phase   drugs currently in this stage phase   drugs in this phase phase   drugs in this final stage
 strong financial reserves to support ongoing development
    biontech maintains a strong cash position with  billion in cash cash equivalents and security investments as of september  
 strategic shift towards highgrowth areas like oncology and personalized medicine
    initiated two phase  trials in smallcell lung cancer sclc and triplenegative breast cancer tnbc
    planning phase  trials based on phase  outcomes
    presented encouraging data in advanced tnbc egfrmutated nsclc and renal cell carcinoma at esmo 

to raise a question i have little expertise in biology myself and i deem the companys ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from covid vaccine revenues i want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the companys new drugs as well as the potencial for success this will heavily influence my decision for investment thanks in advance other thoughts are also open and welcomed","['im a doctor and i can explain how things really work i was formerly a principal investigator meaning i was a specialist doctor that actually ran and was completely responsible for clinical trials\n\nthey got very lucky with the covid story since at that time any semi half ass decent vaccine would get fast tracked by the fda\n\nnow coming to the present time they have a huge pipeline for oncology and in very difficult cancers such as triplenegative breast cancer  this is the absolute toughest breast cancer type having stuff in clinical trials is far from any guarantee\n\nphase  is just safety testing to come to a maximum tolerated dose or more often used term now maximum recommended dose very few patients maybe a dozen or two\n\nphase  still has very few patients but can be up to  and is in a targeted population here we look for efficacy is the drug efficacious ie does the drug have antitumour activity for oncology trials here is where the high barrier to success comes because even if efficacy is observed phase  comes next with high barrier\n\nphase  comparing new drug to standard of care standard of care is hard to beat because chemotherapy does an immensely amazing job of treating cancer despite the rough side effects it is extremely hard to therefore beat the standard of care\n\ntldr very very very few drugs will ever make it through phase  and be fda approved', 'might be a good play but i got burned badly when covid ended and my position tanked \n\nsorry but i wont touch this stock anytime soon', 'biontech is developing the only promising mpox vaccine\n\n']",15,1731944536.0

Tax Loss Harvesting,"question regarding hedging with tax loss harvesting what are the pros and cons of this strategy what am i missing 

say i buy  worth of voog today 

if it drops  and i sell causing a k loss i get to write that off on my taxes then i would immediately purchase  in qqq to avoid wash  is mild correction territory not a huge collapse so id expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the qqq and then im back to where i started plus k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation 

if voog goes up then i happily hold onto the shares and let them rise ","['im just curious what constitutes a similar security i think its considered a wash sale if you just turn around and buy something similar right but what is similar', 'thats how it works the one caveat is that its not all positive as it changes your cost basis in your scenario if it goes back up to k and you sell it youd be taxed on k k at time of sale its more of a tax deferral than just free money', 'there is no downside to tax loss harvesting as long as you avoid the wash sale rule and find something else that will give similar or better returns', 'deleted', 'if you expect voog to go back up why sell it unless you are offsetting gains or reducing income for a specific income point but thats limited to k so not very helpful \n\nif you sell today and take a k loss sure you get to deduct that from this years taxes but if qqq then goes back to k and goes up then you will owe tax on that gain from  which could be a bigger tax issue maybe depending on bracket and amount \n\nime tax loss harvesting is rarely much useful selling stuff that is no longer worth it is useful  selling just for some tlh normally isnt \n\nymmv', 'another way to look at it\n\nsay you have a mix of stocks in your portfolio valued at k not just a fund during some good day the mix delivers you say k return if you sell the stocks that gained in your mix for k you will pay a capital gain tax on this sale however some particular stocks in your mix have probably lost k of value so if you sell those and next day sell those that gained your total losses would be larger than the capital gain and you dont pay tax on those k your mix earned']",12,1731943362.0

EQIX and DLR - are they benefitting at all from AI datacenter buildouts?,"i had been wondering if datacenter reits such as eqix and dlr would benefit from the big ai datacenter rollouts  specifcally from amzn aws and msft azure

My research and direction of ABNB,"hi everyone

putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me

i am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last  years of my time trading investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green

so based on their push and possibly for my validation too i have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it either way this would help me make it better everytime also i trade as well as invest a lot via options so at any point of time i might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks i reseach

i am based out of melbourne australia and use ibkr and tastytrade for trading in us markets

i do technical analysis too but to be honest i do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  i rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me whether a stock is overvalued undervalued or worth its current evalation none of the companies that i pick to tradego longshort are a quick trades usually my trades bear fruit in  to  months or sometime much longer hence i use the options way no complex options techniques but just a simple callput to enter with low capital and stay in longer than i could afford if i had gone the cash way

i spent a lot of time last week evaluating airbnb stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in feb  then the numbers that come out in feb  should decide the fate from then onwards anything after that would be a speculation

based on my  analysis of airbnbs financial performance market position and the industry trend i recommend a short position on abnb stock while the company has shown impressive growth and resilience several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term

as with any data modelling i have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action and please note this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below

as for me i would be entering a short position when the market opens todayth nov

financial and fundamental analysis

 valuation concerns  
airbnbs current valuation appears stretched with a forward pe ratio of approximately x as of the last reporting date significantly higher than the industry average this premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment

 slowing growth  
while airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its ipo the rate of growth is decelerating yearoveryear revenue growth has slowed from tripledigit percentages in  to more modest doubledigit growth in recent quarters this trend may continue as the company faces tougher yearoveryear comparisons and market saturation in key regions

 regulatory headwinds  
airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide cities like new york barcelona and amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on shortterm rentals which could impact airbnbs inventory and revenue potential in these key markets

 increasing competition  
the shortterm rental market is becoming increasingly competitive with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like vrbo expedia group gaining market share this intensifying competition may pressure airbnbs margins and market position

 macroeconomic uncertainties  
the travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions with concerns about inflation potential recession and geopolitical tensions consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease negatively impacting airbnbs bookings and revenue

 profitability concerns  
while airbnb has recently achieved profitability its margins remain thin the companys efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term

technical analysis

 bearish trend  
the stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in february  forming lower highs and lower lows this suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum

 moving average crossover  
the day moving average has recently crossed below the day moving average forming a death cross this bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price

 resistance levels  
abnb stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices

 relative strength index rsi  
the rsi has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the  level in recent months suggesting weakness in buying momentum

 volume analysis  
recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume while selloffs have seen higher volume this pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant

risks to short thesis

 innovation and new revenue streams  
airbnbs continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment

 travel industry recovery  
a strongerthanexpected rebound in global travel could boost airbnbs bookings and revenue potentially leading to positive earnings surprises

 margin improvement  
if airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through costcutting measures or increased efficiency it could lead to betterthanexpected profitability

conclusion  
while airbnb remains a leader in the shortterm rental market with a strong brand and global presence the combination of stretched valuation slowing growth regulatory challenges and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk i would be initiating a short position in abnb stock using either a march or april  put option with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis

Creating Stop Loss on Webull? ,im trying to create my first stop loss on webull  my confusion is the limit price could i essentially raise that to  the stock is at sound  right now i want to limit my loss but i dont want a limit on the gains id appreciate the help ,"['it sounds like youre talking about a stop limit order you have to pick a stop price and a limit price the stop price being reached triggers the trade at the limit price the limit price exists in case the stock is in total freefall and you dont want to sell too low\n\nso for example if you set a regular stop loss order to trigger at  but the stock plummets to  in seconds your trade could very well be executed at  a stop limit prevents this  you could set the stop price at  and the limit price at  and the trade will only execute if theres enough liquidity at \n\na stop limit with a stop price at  and a limit price at  will not execute at all', 'is there such a thing as a stoplimit  where it will sell at either a higher or lower bound', 'i know this isnt what youre asking but i think stops are dumb depends on your strategy but i do not recommend using them unless youre like day trading options\n\nand if youre already day trading options and asking this question yikes', 'why are you using webull\xa0']",3,1731946835.0
Most Efficient Way to Track Public Trades?,"hey everyone

im trying to find a good free resource to track public trades but im running into some issues

i know about open insider but when i search for people like elon musk i only see one trade from  where he sold tesla stock for someone like nancy pelosi nothing comes up at all

i also tried the edgar system but for elon i could only find  trades again i couldnt find anything at all on pelosi

does anyone know of a more reliable platform where i can see trades for highprofile individuals or am i just not using these tools correctly","['i dont know where you find it but tracking mr pelosis trades would be a good idea   he knows how to invest', 'something along the lines of quiver quantitative', 'gurufocus but you dont get the most recent data in the free version if i remember it correctly', 'for congress go to \n\nfor some individual ones  has some good ones', 'quiverquant']",20,1731879849.0

RedCat DD,"im back with the redcat dd that i promised 

redcat is an american drone company that as of last week has been chosen as the sole provider of small rucksack portable attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities to none other than the united states army 

through a program of record initiated  years ago short range reconnaissance srr the us army was able to test research evaluate and compare capabilitieslimitations of drones from  companies including boeing lockheed martin and the reigning champion from srr tranche  skydio they also fielded these drones in ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and competent near peer adversary needless to say redcat provided a far superior drone purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner 

oh its one little army contract for around  drones how is that important

great question looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school 

as mentioned previously srr testing began in  now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in  just  years after the army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime yep you got it russia invaded ukraine heres a sticker for you to add to your helmet if you havent been watching the drone footage from the ukrainian war you should probably get on that 

drones have completely changed the battlefield ukrainian forces are currently usinglosing at least  drones a month with some  drones in the air everyday to reiterate  years ago before russia invaded ukraine before drones were proven in combat before ukraine was burning through  a month to fight one of our near peers the army decided they would like about  

do the math do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on earth would order  weeks worth of drones and call it good you know the answer to this question why dont you have free medical care why do you have k in student loans why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you

fantastic youre right again  of the us federal budget goes straight to the dod a cool  billion im sure youre losing focus but im certain your wifes boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer now add this one up if you are engaged in conflict with another world power where do you want to put your money do you want to buy the k drone that can target anything from the sky completely unmanned or do you want to spend  million on a single m abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an fpv attack drone killing the entire crew 

let me say this another way you are america and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower are you buying  tanks or  drones  drones or a single f  drones or  fs how about raising taxes and buying both

i am not the secretary of defense but i can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by us military leadership in the very near future the dod will be acquiring more than  drones a whole lot more 

in case you arent aware the us army is americas largest branch of the armed forces this means they have more money to rd than their counterparts with some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millionsbillions finding the best product and buy it after they do theyll do exactly that this reality extends beyond the american dod 

how about australia heres a start 



red cat to supply flightwave edge  blue systems to royal australian navy

i hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big armys testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones srr is really only the beginning 

for those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of taiwan you might want to give these articles a read 





the future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems why did we leave vietnam unpopularity back home moms had enough of losing their sons how long can america sustain a war outspending usd when americas cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and american lives we might just deter our adversaries in a way they dont want to engage us anyways 

that leads me to the next point drones as a deterrence factor how many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough how many does the entire dod need on hand how many do our allies want   a million how many combat drones do you speculate that americas military industrial complex wants on hand i cant give you a definitive answer so unfortunately youll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills i can say however that im pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones

now enough market analysis lets talk about some numbers ucynicalmelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day

here is my prediction stock price potential based on updated calculations
current market capitalization  million

current stock price 

shares outstanding approximately  million

projected fiscal year  revenue  million

industry revenue multiple  annual revenue

implied valuation

implied market capitalization  million     billion

implied stock price  billion   million shares  approximately  per share

potential upside         approximately  increase

this analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future 

the stock market is forward looking now look forward so you can get an edge the us drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around b expected to increase to b by  



sure maybe the american drone industry will only double over the next  years the thing is all bets are off ifwhen we go to war where will that money go 

if you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent where is your capital going to be safest this is your opportunity to build some conviction how will the us stock market hold up if we go to war individual companies how about if we dont answer those same questions but with redcat we get sucked in and large scale war begins voo  rcat  place your bets

by current business prospects rcat is criminally undervalued it should have traded at  the moment the srr winner was announced also is there a more reliable source of consistent paymentsbusiness than providing services to the us militarygovernment

this image was not my work but here is some price modeling data



if you can buy cheaper than  youre getting a deal if you understand the gravity of the srr win there is much more to follow this is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year most of yall have never heard the word profits so taxes isnt a problem for you but for the  people in here that arent regarded this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains buy calls exercise them or sell them buy shares keep them whatever you wanna do this company is promising with a bright future i do apologize that i didnt post this earlier i have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed until a few days ago its been under m market cap wanted and tried to post dd back in july 

ask your questions and ill do the best i can to answer them

Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting—The Journey is Far from Over 🚀,"alright everbody lets talk about where were at with achr

since my first post back in october archer has climbed over  and now sits above  the steep incline has been exciting but the journey is far from over heres a look at whats been happening weve got major news strong forecasts and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid let me break it down

analyst price target are bullish  
analysts are projecting an average price target of  with some forecasts reaching as high as  new coverage from needham just slapped a buy rating on it the trajectory upward

 funds are on board  
institutional interest in achr is growing with  funds now holding positionsup  last quarter total shares owned by institutions increased by over  showing confidence in archers growth big money sees the potential

insider activity  growing buzz  
insider transactions over the past  months show strong confidence from within the company

  insider buys totaling m shares with only  sells amounting to m shares
 in the last  months alone there were  insider buys totaling over m shares

this aligns with the momentum weve seen recently with a flood of news analyst ratings and community discussions driving achr into the spotlight the buzz isnt just from the outside people on the inside clearly see the potential too

major nyc news  
archers partner skyports infrastructure and groupe adp have been selected to operate the downtown manhattan heliport a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to nyc together with united airlines the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter cleaner and more affordable urban air mobility for new yorkers this is a massive step forward

global expansion  commercialization strategy  
archers plans go beyond the us theyre actively positioning themselves for deployment in the middle east asia and india with key partnerships already in place their threestep commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year

 piloted demonstration flights in key markets
 market survey trips carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes
 fullscale commercial operations postcertification

india with its large urban markets is shaping up to be one of archers biggest opportunities supported by their partnership with interglobe enterprises

production facility nearing completion  
archers new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks this factory will begin producing typedesign aircraft next year ramping up to a production rate of two aircraft per month by the end of  with plans to scale even further in  this marks a significant step toward realworld operations and commercial readiness

the journey continues  
for those already in congrats on riding this wave for those still watching its not too late after such a strong climb while some might expect a pullback in my view consolidations arent guaranteed momentum has been holding steady and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook even if there are minor dips theres no reason to get nervous let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin with upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch the shortterm and longterm potential both look strong

tldr achr is up over  but still has room to run nyc institutional backing and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner the ride isnt over yet join if youre ready to see whats next 

wishing everyone a great thanksgiving and hoping for some gains this week to cover an extra turkey or two

"$CBL: The Shopping REIT that Screws Banks and Has 2-3x Upside to Comps
","tldr at bottom for my adhd brethren

cbl is playing d chess in the retail reit game unlike the high majority retail reits ive seen it has nonrecourse loans what does that mean it means that if a property isnt pulling its weight they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away to simplify

 cbl buys a property with loans like a mortgage
 property works out  cbl wins
 property doesnt work out  cbl can simply walk away and the bank takes the property but cannot go after other assets cbl only loses what they put in analogous to down payment not a huge l

this is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers depending on what comp you use it seems like cbl could fairly be x higher in stock price it has better operating metrics and roic



so if its so great who owns it

well theres  insider ownership this is insanely high so management and insiders like oaktree howard marks think it looks good but this has a side effect that is negative for exposure it also makes the float low so institutions cant easily buy in but to solve this problem cbl is using its  cash flow yield to buy back shares theyve nuked  of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure 

so essentially this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties and is now printing cash buying back shares and bullying lenders there are several catalysts on the near horizon

 lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company so if the economy shows softness which it has rates will come down even more and help it
 the company recently has had great momentum  in past month and this indicates more and more interest
 new buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in feb

heres what makes it especially interesting as far as i can tell shrts were fairly lazy and just thought

hmm this is some random shopping mall reit hurr durr lets sell it plus it emerged from bankruptcy it must have had bad performance yep hurr durr 

this has led to  si which is very significant for this sector

if you are generally concerned with this play i would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other lesser performing reits which should get rid of most sector risk then you sit around and wait management is insanely aligned with you the company is on fire and its going to get even better if rates lower in the meantime you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back

i bought calls that expire after the next fomc which should be a good catalyst if they lower rates ive been banking so far

MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,"sorry if someone already talked about how this really works but lets get into the details here on why mstr is able to get  loans on billions every time they do a debt offering many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying  convertible notes from mstr after all there is a reasonable chance mstr goes bankrupt if btc has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature and a company like this youd expect double digit interest on a loan

but of course these are convertible notes the most recent offering is convertible at  per share if my napkin math is correct so they are essentially a  loan with a free   call option it turns out that call option is incredibly valuable dont take my word for it just check the market

according to yahoo finance a  mstr jan call traded around  on friday a jan  call traded around  so youd expect a   call should be worth nearly  so just by buying the note youre getting about  worth of call options per share you can instantly hedge this position by selling the  call and grabbing  this sets up the following scenarios

 mstr goes above  your call buyer exercises you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise you net  per share   call you are out the share you used from your principal to convert you have a gain of  on  initial for a profit of  which takes a maximum of  years expiry of the call option to materialize
 your call buyer never exercises you hold through to expiry you now have your initial investment  keep the full option premium you sold   per share you still have y until your convertible note expires meaning you can potentially sell another call for added roi you pocket  for every  invested for a gain of  in  years eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment mstr is not bankrupt
 mstr goes tits up sometime around  you get to keep the option premium you sold of course and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor unless btc goes to below k or something youd expect to get back  of your initial investment with the loan and option premium

with this in mind all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play they are able to do this because the iv on their stock is absolutely bananas this makes their call options incredibly valuable mstr is trading volatility for cash and people are lining up to participate

so long as the stock remains volatile which seems likely they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them meanwhile they are using the cash to buy btc which puts huge upward pressure on the market and subsequently pumps their stock and creates even more demand for their notes

$PCT (Purecycle) is on the prowl and ready to explode. Get in while you can,"so youre rolling in money from asstits rklb and achr youre too scared to yolo into mstr pct is now at a similar stage as when asstits had their first test satellite in the air or archer first flew their evtol theyve shown it can work now comes the commercialization and scaling

purecycle has invented a revolutionary new way to recycle plastic most plastic you put in the recycle bin today gets burned or thrown away theyve finally figured out a way to actually reuse this shit recycle symbol  and are scaling up production and signing contrats right now just so you can get in on the ground floor other brands want their product because it makes them look good to their customers that theyre using recycled plastic and its cheaper too im pretty sure

 the technology



these guys have been dropping corporate hype videos in recent weeks because theyre finally getting cocky that their shit works im honestly not exactly sure whats happening here but it seems like the new plastic theyre making in their ohio factory is pure as hell



heres another video from today of their ceo flexing their facility in denver which apparently sources old plastic to make the new plastic again not entirely sure what im looking at here but this guy is a dawg and lives for this shit which is what you want in a ceo my takeaway is they finally are getting quality old plastic to make into elite new plastic at scale

they also have a sick new rd facility in north carolina to learn how to keep churning out purer and purer product

 commercial demand

this tech was actually made by pg and licensed to purecycle to scale pg is their first customer in addition according to their q purecycle has allocated  of the augusta facility output for lines  and  to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated im pretty sure that means that for their second factory in georgia they already have  of sales made and are actively working on the rest

now that the tech works their focus this year and qq  is commercialization this is the time to get in because once they announce those juicy contracts this thing is gone

to be clear this is a risky prerevenue growth company so scaling is not guaranteed however it finally seems to be derisked enough from a technology standpoint and the deals theyre making now show this

 financials

their excfo said they were modeling their profit margins to be  theyre taking shit that people dont want and would actually pay to get rid of and making it useful they still may need to raise more shares to fund all their build out

short interest is high but the price is on an up trend they will eventually need to cover



volume is low bid  ask spread is high on options so you will get fleeced by market makers

PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"on november   pltrs board member alex moore tweeted

we are moving palantirtech to nasdaq because it will force billions in etf buying and deliver tendies to our retail investors player haters be aware that weve been hated for decades plural everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following

immediately afterwards he deleted his tweet

at first glance the statement seems harmless and even obvious companies are addedremoved from passive indexes every day and its not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns theres no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion it doesnt affect the fundamental business anyway

right

i think otherwise

alex moore said palantirs quiet part out loud i contend that this has been palantirs gameplan since day one the stocks performance ridiculous valuation and mania all points back to one fundamental goal of the companys management manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling

the evidence so mike green

part  the listing

companies generally list via a direct listing traditional ipo or spac for a company the size of pltr a spac was out of the question they had to choose between an ipo and direct listing lets take a look at both

traditional ipo typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal setting a price and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds importantly these shares are not part of the stocks free float and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market

direct listing in a direct listing a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital this avoids traditional ipo underwriters investment bank the free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell palantir chose this route

takeaway in a direct listing all existing shares held by insiders employees and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately there is no lockup period common in traditional ipos where insiders are restricted from selling shares for  months this approach ensures a larger float right from the start as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose increasing the number of shares available for trading

why is this important

palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the first week of listing because palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes

 market cap  this is self explanatory palantir began listing at b market cap rendering it eligible for most indexes
 free float  indexes are not just weighted by a companys market cap the sp for example uses floatadjusted market cap adjusting the companys market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index floatadjusted market capshare pricefree float shares
 liquidity  also a no brainer considering the number of shares immediately available for the public and the hype around the stock

it doesnt take a genius to see it as insiders sell shares the effective float rose requiring extra purchases from index providers and helping palantir insiders exit

vanguard  liquidity 

part  buying a seat at the table

 was tough for palantir the index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged this threatened their ultimate goal of sp  nasdaq  inclusion they had the market cap if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements

so they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do and bought customers financing customer growth by investing roughly mm in over two dozen spacs palantir was basically buying revenue

the process was straightforward

 pltr would invest in the spac and assume a significant controlling interest
 pltr would use the spacs funds to purchase pltr services
 any operating losses of the spac company could be carefully hidden from pltrs reporting

not part of operating income

and soon enough pltr was technically reporting profitability by gaap standards with the company now profitable in  it became eligible for sp inclusion and was included in september  coinciding with a facemelting rally

part  the next frontier

to wind out its strategy palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion capped off by its relisting to nasdaq to position itself for entry into the nasdaq qqq

the timing of the move is also suspect the indexs modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents disproportionately favoring midtier companies ranked between  and  in market capexactly where palantir has maneuvered itself

this move is no coincidence palantirs ownership by the big three institutional investorsvanguard blackrock and state streethas soared to an impressive  surpassing even tech giants like microsoft  apple  and nvidia  for a company that only went public in q this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size

and the insiders theyre loving the exit liquidity



in fact theyve been dumping into the institutions and retail this whole time



show me the incentive and i will tell you the outcome

institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders theyre brainless rulesbased buyers and once the entire world owns an equal share of your company priced at x sales and youve dumped most of your shares you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock

of course index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals the net b of projected inflows from the qqq have contributed about b of market cap growth in just the past few weeks

overall i think theres huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes knowing its full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity pltr is just one of many and theyre giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak

tldr the recent pltr tweet about joining the qqq was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first seen in wsb   weeks ago\ntotal comments    previous best dd  \naccount age   months

traditional lockups palantir restricted  of insider shares for  months until february  from september   after the q  earnings release insiders employees early investors etc were allowed to sell up to\xa0 of their holdings immediately\n i think you misunderstand what happened with the spacs it definitely is a grey area but not illegal so its more like gaming the system the spac revenue did improve palantirs reported revenue growth but profitability a key factor for sp  inclusion remained elusive until  spacrelated revenue didnt directly manipulate inclusion it was a shortterm boost that eventually faded\n\npalantirs growth during this time was largely organic which makes the argument about juicing their books with spac investments less convincing sure spacs may have temporarily boosted revenue by locking in software contracts but how do you sustain that growth and actually become profitable without constantly reinvesting in new spacs you dont\n\npalantir didnt invest in any spacs in  or  so their profitability by  couldnt have come from artificially inflated revenue tied to spacs why because not all of those spacbacked companies succeeded and without new spac investments to keep the cycle going they had to shift to real organic growth to move toward profitability\n\nfinal notes the sp  requires a company to be\xa0profitable on a gaap basis\xa0for the most recent

game than a reflection of financial reality right now its shifting towards an ai software narrative who knows for how long were here to play the game and hit it big i dont fault you for your thinking

 they do split it google goes about its business making billions and now chrome belongs to someone else or in its own thing google can just launch a new browser off chromium open source project heck even if somehow they are forbidden from ever launching a browser again they can get away influencing the chrome foundation or whatever like theyve done with mozilla through partnershipdonations its not like their core business is chrome anyways same deal goes with android they can fork or influence even post split maybe if they took youtube theyd be hit badly but still carry on making dough off search alone

 they dont split it biz as usual but you just got in a good entry point

Energy Fuels ($UUUU) Poised for Significant Growth ,"overview

energy fuels together with its subsidiaries engages in the extraction recovery recycling exploration permitting evaluation and sale of uranium mineral properties in the united states the company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite rutile zircon and monazite

explanation of element and mineral importance

uranium  this is the fuel for nuclear reactors please see my post on uranium if you want to understand the significance of it and why energy fuels will massively benefit from it link here  

vanadium  a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries vrfbs which are used for energy storage systems due to shifts toward renewable energy sources the demand for efficient largescale energy storage is increasing vrfbs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability long lifespan and ability to discharge over a long period making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy this shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital

swot on vrfbs guidehouse insights

the nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutronabsorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance these properties make vanadiumbased alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components the ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation extends the service life of these components enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants

vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel

rare earth elements rees

ndpr  a combination of two rare earth elements neodymium nd and praseodymium pr these elements are both crucial in the production of highstrength permanent magnets called ndfeb magnets their powerful magnetic properties are essential in electric vehicles wind turbines consumer electronics and defense technologies energy fuels is one of the few us companies able to commercialize the production of separated ndpr

growth projection for rees in energy transition source adamas intelligence

ndfeb magnets and why they are important

neodymiumironboron magnets are a type of permanent magnet they are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact with the energy transition going on demand for these magnets is increasing significantly yoy

demand for ndfeb magnets worldwide from 

ndfeb magnet content

as we can see in the chart ndpr accounts for about a third of ndfeb magnets composition

heavy mineral sands

ilmenite  mined and processed to produce titanium oxide tio tio is used in paints coatings and plastics which allows uuuu to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas

zircon  used for manufacturing ceramics refractory materials and foundry molds also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants and for pet imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics

rutile  similar to ilmenite rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable

monazite  a rare mineral that contains rareearth elements such as ndpr and elements like uranium and thorium used as a feedstock by energy fuels in their processing endeavors at white mesa mill 

energy fuels competitive advantage

white mesa mill

  owned by energy fuels is the only facility in the usa able to process monazite to produce rees

 the only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the us

 completed phase  ree facility with up to  tonnes of separated ndpr production capacity

 largest producer of vanadium in the us production on standby currently due to low vanadium prices strong inventory on hand

average revenue growth for the last  years has been 

i know these numbers dont look great the negative ebitda is not something to worry about in my opinion mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding although once these mines are up and running heavy mineral sands mining is low cost combined with the high price of uranium profitability is so close they are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets the company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities with assets that doubled from  to  in the next year i believe we will see positive ebitda due to mines becoming operational instead of sitting idle



 q  highlights

 very good balance sheet with over  million of liquidity and no debt

 uranium prices continue to drive revenue sold  pounds of uo at spot price of  proceeds totaling  million gross profit margin of 

 new longterm uranium contract expected delivery of  pounds between  and 

 produced  tonnes of separated ndpr at white mesa mill

 ndpr produced at white mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers setting the stage for growth

 strong uranium inventory consisting of  pounds finished uo  pounds of uo in ore and raw materials expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations

 a large vanadium inventory of  pounds finished vo

acquisition of radtran llc

on august th  energy fuels announced it acquired radtran a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes since  energy fuels and radtran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium and radium from uranium processing at white mesa mill these recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium and lead these isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers there is currently a global shortage of ra and ra therefore limiting the supply of ac and pb this is a huge acquisition for energy fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand

acquisition of base resources

on october nd  energy fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of base resources this is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production including titanium zirconium rees and uranium this is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the toliara project in madagascar this is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best hms heavy mineral sands projects in the world

conclusion

i think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for vanadium and rees with a stockpile of  pounds of vo they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand they are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium as we continuously rely less on foreign nations with  pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of  million pounds of uo per year the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and longterm contracts with strategic acquisitions of base resources and radtran the company clearly demonstrates commitment to strategic growth and innovation at a current price of  i believe within  years this company will triple in price to around ","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first seen in wsb   months ago\ntotal comments    previous best dd  x x x x x x x x \naccount age   months   \n\njoin wsb discord', 'long ass dd  me not reading a single word but getting in because you took the time to do it \n\nthanks', 'our ai tracks our most intelligent users after parsing your posts we have concluded that you are within the th percentile of all wsb users\n\ni am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorwallstreetbets if you have any questions or concerns', 'the companys had no significant growth in its almost  years of existence', 'ccj  better play', 'founded in  stock has been a zombie for the past  years latest financials\n\nrevenuem\n\n\n\nnet incomem\n\ndiluted eps\nnet profit marginrevenue\tm\t net income\tm\t diluted eps\t\t net profit margin\t\t \n\nno']",8,1732596265.0
Orange Juice Crisis," overview

there is currently an ongoing orange juice crisis here i explain what is happening in the orange market and what metricsinformation an orange investor should look out for

 context a perfect shitstorm of weather and disease

orange juice has become very expensive so much so that oj has been one of the top performers in the chicago mercantile exchange excluding btc since  below is a graphical representation



fig  orange juice futures candlestick vs major commodities crude oil green copper blue gold purple silver mint soybeans red

since  oj has risen in price by more than  this dwarfs the performance of other major commodities some of which had arguably very good runs themselves

so what exactly happened to oj there are two both of which concern the crops supply side adverse weather events and citrus greening

first on adverse weather climate change is nothing new as of late however the damage done to crops due to extreme weather effects seem to be on the rise both in terms of frequency and intensity it also just happens so that brazil was hit the hardest recording its hottest ever temperature in  this is serious news for oj because brazil alone supplies  of the world market needless to say extreme heat is never good for crops  for oranges in particular it significantly increases premature fruit drops which diminishes yields for plantations



fig  brazil change in average mean surface air temperature  source world bank group temperature in brazil has been steadily increasing since the s



fig  brazil change in distribution of average maximum surface air temperature   source world bank group not only has the average temperature been rising in brazil the extremities of droughts are also trending upwards extremities are the real crop killers

to get the absolutely worst outcome combine this with a tree disease that has no known cure citrus greening citrus greening causes citrus fruit to stay green instead of ripening turning it bitter and inedible and causes the trees to produce less fruit over time once a tree is infected it typically dies within  years there is currently no known cure the disease is also highly contagious virtually all trees in florida which used to top even brazil in oj production at one time is infected by citrus greening florida barely produces any oranges these days and most juice makers have already left their groves fig  as for brazil fundecitrus estimated in  that  of the plants in the brazilian citrus belt had symptoms of citrus greening citrus beltc howeverc alsohave symptoms of the disease



fig  us domestic production of oranges florida now makes less than  of what it used to make just  years ago most citrus trees died due to citrus greening and most grove owners never replanted

as a result oj inventory is currently at historically low levels fig  fig  which explains the squeeze in its price usda estimated that the  growing season for citrus was the least productive since 



fig  citrusbr oj inventory june  marked the lowest oj inventory levels in brazil since  years ago



fig  us oj cold storage stocks inventory has decreased from  million lbs in  to   in  a near  drop in just three years

 future of orange juice

so where will the price of oj be in the next few years this is where we get into speculative territory though the most natural response from a degen ape would be to short the hell out of this thing before we do so however let us look at some reasons why oj will have no choice but to come down in price

somewhat predictable nature of the nio index

extreme heat that damages crops in southern brazil where the citrus belt is located is almost always is accompanied by el nio el nio occurs when the pacific ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others la nia is the opposite pattern where the same region of the pacific becomes cooler than normal also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions these patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently based on its geographical location for brazil and the citrus belt in particular el nio is the more serious problem because el nio generally brings heat while la nia takes it away



fig  nio index source golden gate weather services just from a glance the index seems to closely resemble a normal distribution extreme events happen at lower frequencies than less extreme events and the index oscillates between el nio and la nia in a predictable pattern

heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering brazils citrus production in the  growing season citrusbr this means that as long as we dont see another very strong el nio in the near future we can be assured of successful orange harvests in brazil based on historical data fig  the nio index seems to follow a normal distribution with la nia usually following strong el nios given the fact that we just had a very strong el nio in  there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years

if this is true a cooler temperature in brazil for the next  years should increase output and put downward pressure back on the price of oj strong caveat nobody can forecast the weather with  accuracy that is why i say somewhat but the math seems grounded and nature at least meanreverting

substitution effect

we can also rely on macroeconomic forces to make forecasts

oj is not a need it is also has many substitutes consumers have a variety of juices to choose from in the supermarket if oj is too expensive they can easily buy apple or grapefruit juice moreover retail juice makers eg cocacola are looking to use alternative fruits like mandarins to produce their orange juice

therefore in the longterm even in the unlikely scenario where the citrus supply shock never recovers high prices for oj will drive demand down ultimately leading to a lower price high price is the cure for high prices for goods that have clear substitutes and are not veblen

potential cure for citrus greening

scientists in florida may have found the cure for citrus greening however the work is only preliminary and more time and tests will be needed to prove its efficacy

 notes on trading oj

oj can be shorted on ice futures pt move on an oj contract translates to a  pl current price of oj is  the average price of oj presupply shock was approximately  assuming that the current price reverts back to the mean an investor can therefore expect to make a profit of  with a k maintenance margin per contract the actual profit will most likely be lower however because of the big spreads in oj oj is not a liquid contract and rollover risk still oj presents a good opportunity for speculators at this point in time for reasons mentioned above

tldr oj is overpriced short it at your own risk","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first seen in wsb   months ago\ntotal comments    previous best dd  \naccount age   years   \n\njoin wsb discord', 'fuck you ive seen trading places', 'theyll probably just dilute orange juice even more than it is now to avoid a crisis in a few years well be drinking orangebchemical with some sugar and water added', 'squeeeeeze', 'our ai tracks our most intelligent users after parsing your posts we have concluded that you are within the th percentile of all wsb users\n\ni am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorwallstreetbets if you have any questions or concerns', 'so puts on cocacola', 'love me a glass of mass market oj combined and refined from who the hell knows where', 'as for the el nio aspect pretty sure large farmers and others are aware of forecasts like this and said information is likely known by that market potentially adjusting outputs etc not a farmer but know a few', 'citron research is that you']",5,1732604937.0

the revenues that these companies are generating are not at all adjusted to the prices at which their stocks are trading at we are in a overconcentrated and overvalued market environment

the same is happening today with ai we started with nvidia and we are still in the honeymoon phase with it however we are starting to see many other ai related startups and companies there is a big speculation about this industry and the idea that it will revolutionize the world altough it most likely will we must have into account that this is the economy we are talking about and we are talking about fair value

fees and opportunity cost of not putting your money into something that will actually generate a return \n\nstocks have a mean average return of something like  and that gets better if you increase your risk levels up to a point this levels off around  sure inflation fees tax and spread will still significantly cut into your returns but statistics is on your side in the long run \n\nthis page is fun but those statistically unlikely enough to make significant returns get upvoted to the top of the page and give the perception that no only is making money possible but you might even be able to do it intentionally with options this is not the case\n\nnow if you have no interest in being a cuck to the system and watching your relatively small amount of savings turn into slightly larger amount of savings over a long period of time and just want to roll the dice to get rich quick then options might be for you i would recommend playing the game for as little time as possible so as to give

🔋 Bloom Energy’s 95% Run: The Hidden Energy Play Behind AI Data Centers,"bloom energy be surged  on nov  and is now up   
while its unclear if the rally will pause or continueand you should be mindful that as i just said she has already soared this post explores why this move is more than a shortterm trend with highly significant catalysts on the horizon

bloom energy servers

ai is booming and its not a fad have you heard of nvda of course you have and you know the demand for its semiconductors is insane here are key insights from last wednesdays nvda earnings call

 hopper demand is exceptional
 blackwell demand is staggering
 nvda is racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand
 the next wave of ai is enterprise ai and industrial ai



ai isnt just the futureits here and scaling rapidly these semiconductors are being used to build advanced data centers but to turn on these data centers you cannot just plug all that processing power into the wall outlet they require specialized power setups from their local energy utility

connecting a data center to the grid requires major upgrades due to their immense energy demands and need for reliability

dedicated substations data centers need substations with highcapacity transformers and switchgear to step down grid power building or upgrading a substation can take  years due to permitting engineering and construction delays

transmission line upgrades highvoltage lines may need new installations conductor upgrades or pole reinforcements often delayed by land acquisition environmental reviews and public opposition

distribution network enhancements local networks require upgrades like redundant feeders voltage regulators and new lines to ensure stable delivery from substations to data centers

redundancy and reliability to meet  uptime demands utilities need to build costly redundant systems including backup transmission lines and ring configurations to eliminate single points of failure

furthermore data centers consume immense amounts of electricity often beyond what utilities can supply slow by nature utilities are vastly unprepared for the aidriven demand surge and they are struggling to respond

besides upgrading grid infrastructure requires billions of dollars and takes years with delays from zoning public consultations and environmental reviews as a result companies that want to develop their data centers face growing waiting lists for power risking their competitive edge in an industry where delays of even months can be critical

this isnt hypotheticalits happening now ive included several sources and citations at the end



enter bloom energy be which sells onsite power generators that can run data centers without relying on the grida proven solution used for years in hospitals factories and offgrid installations

on nov  afterhours american electric power aep a major utility that operates in  states and is struggling to meet data center energy demands struck a deal with bloom energy instead of making clients wait years or relocate aep will offer blooms energy servers enabling data centers to power up in months not years and stay competitive

this is a gamechanger for bloom energy theyve shifted from selling servers to individual clients to partnering with utility giant aepa move from retail to wholesale

blooms technology isnt new but the aep deal marks a leap to scalable utilityscale partnerships unlocking massive demand



a company wanting to develop a data center i need energy for my data center  
aep well be able to accommodate you until mid you can wait move to a location where the grid is already upgraded but you need to hurry because those spaces are limited or we can install these bloom energy servers and youll have your energy in  days

for those who grasp this jump from retail to wholesale the opportunity is clear  
careful though my entry was over a week ago and she has been running a lot already however every new aep order or fingers crossed any other major utility signing a new agreement with bloom energy wink emoji

do your own research though and for those who want to dive deeper into the details here are the sources i used to inform my play

aep press release  
mckinsey report on how data centers and ai rely on the availability of electric power  
deep dive where my play came from  
reuters article on strong growth in new data center demand  
bloom energy  ai data centers

personally im playing with shares  and im posting now because i was banbetbanned last week  
and again she could keep running north but be careful however this stock is something you should keep on a watchlist



tldr bloom energy be surged  after a deal with aep a major utility struggling to meet energy demands from aidriven data centers bes onsite energy servers bypass the grid enabling data centers to power up in months instead of years this shifts be from retail to wholesale unlocking massive potential sources right above if you want to dive deeper","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first seen in wsb   years ago\ntotal comments    previous best dd  x \naccount age   years   \n\njoin wsb discord', 'interesting play for sure with solid oxide fuel cells because of this post i started a speculative position in plug apparently microsoft had a pilot project with them to power datacenters with hydrogen fuel cells if and thats a big if a utility announces a similar deal with plug they would jump for sure', 'nice post just saw this after posting my own dd on be a few minutes ago good luck to us all', 'you son of a bitch im in', 'im in just got to move some stuff around', 'im playing with shares how about some actual fucking positions', 'cool thanks for posting after the run up are you here trying to lure future bagholders', 'whats your pt', 'do you have a near term  long term price target', 'what is the source of hydrogen where and how do they replenish it its clearly clean and efficient but im curious to the cost per kw can you put that in the dd', 'i didnt buy enough but i was buying and selling plays between  and  and i cleared em all out then literally the week before the spike i bought a scoop of shares for  avg it was a great  gain i just wish i bought more instead of just my registered account at least it was tax free right']",17,1732578882.0

"Elon Musk Sparks Controversy Over F-35 Fighter Jets, Advocates for Drone Warfare","tesla ceo elon musk cohead of the new department of government efficiency doge criticized lockheed martins f stealth fighter on his social media platform x while endorsing drones over manned fighter jets musk referred to the fs design as flawed and called manned jets obsolete in the era of advanced drone warfare his comments sparked a heated online debate and triggered a dip in the stock prices of lockheed martin  northrop grumman  and rtx 

the pentagon defended the f emphasizing its global adoption by allies and its vital role in defense while lockheed martin reaffirmed its commitment to the jets capabilities critics point to the programs high costs delays and reliability issues with the total cost of the f program estimated at  trillion

musk argued that the fs design suffered from attempting to meet the diverse needs of multiple military branches making it an expensive and inefficient jack of all trades he highlighted the pentagons history of fiscal inefficiencies noting its recent failure to pass a seventh consecutive audit

meanwhile the defense industry is increasingly exploring dronebased solutions with startups like anduril and redcat playing a prominent role in innovating unmanned combat systems despite musks critique the pentagon continues to plan for a mixed fleet of manned and unmanned aircraft

How many people here have actually changed their lives trading? For the better or worse? ,"has wsb played a part in your success or failure lastly for those who have changed their lives for the better what strategies helped you make the most money and for those who have changed their lives for the worst how did it happen and what keeps you coming back

ive been inspired by the subreddit and am looking to hear the honest experiences and perspectives of others here on a more serious note before diving into the deep end ironically what is most inspiring to me is the loss porn  theres something about seeing someone lose more than you have in one day and be unphased that moves you

now im looking to take trading seriously not quit my job and go fulltime but devote all my spare time to it

for context ive been in and out the market for years so i am not a complete beginner but have never taken trading seriously before now ive joined call out groups twice in the past but was lost between the lingo and how fast everything was moving now i am going to learn to trade on my own my current plan is to start with  and focus on etf options spy qqq iwm though i will also keep my eyes open for news and catalyst plays that i have the buying power for i am going to use price action and full timeframe continuity to look for openings as that is what i currently know and research other strategies as i go i am also researching tools this time around because ive had trouble with order blocks and resting liquidity in the past which would have gave me better insight into how price might react to hitting a level my current risk management strategy is limit entries to  of my portfolio with a  loss tolerancestop loss i will likely be focusing on iwm while i build my account limiting my losses to  per entry my plan is to lower the entry limit as my account grows but increase my loss tolerance per entry to maybe  i will be using a cash account to avoid bitting off more than i can chew and margin interest cutting into potential profits","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first seen in wsb   months ago\ntotal comments    previous best dd  \naccount age   years   \n\njoin wsb discord', 'i have a  debt and nothing to show for it coz i thought i could make it big trading', 'instead of spending hours scrolling through the cesspool that is general reddit everyday i spend hours scrolling through this dumpster fire of a sub its made me a better man and worse at the same time']",2,1732614331.0

I am short e.l.f Beauty Inc (ELF),"elf beauty inc is a us based cosmetics make up  skin care company

on november th  muddy waters published a report available on the website on alleged irregularities in sales revenue and profits reported by elf in last  quaters

muddy waters asserts the elf imports  of its products from china and as per us imports customs data there has been a steep fall in import volumes therefore elf may have overstated its profits by  m in last  quarters

on the otherhand elf has continued to state that the demand is increasing and therefore it has boosted its inventory to cater to its customers

elf published a rebuttal  which states that it has taken permission to hide its import volumes since feb  to protect the business volumes against competition therefore muddy waters allegations as baseless as they are working with incomplete data sets

in my opinion the response by elf is very weak and unconvincing

made a bad call back in march holding onto what seemed like a pretty safe call debit spread on smci actually posted about it back then too lmao  long story short smci closed right at the short leg strike point so whoever was holding onto the  contracts i was short on decided not to exercise leaving me long on  very pricey and very volatile shares of smci ended up getting margin called that weekend and losing almost k when markets opened that monday

$MARA DD - The MaraStrategy 💊,"preface

disclaimer i use a cringe amount of emoji  also the following is not not financial advice if you lose money thats too bad you gain a life lesson

illiterate  scroll to the bottom follow instructions 

disclosure as of nov nd i have k in various mara calls  some additional funds to buy mara stock on dips i will instantly buy more if fred thiel keeps employing the marastrategy

most of this dd focuses on mara compared to mstr i compared multiple tickers before determining mara was the best play

with that out of the way lets dive into the always sunny bull case for mara  


marastrategy

for this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for btc to go down and it just continues going up think stonks only go up type shit 

thanks to the pioneers and investors in microstrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself mara or marathon digital holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin a shitton of it in fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest btc holdings after mstr

the marastrategy codename  is an ambitious prospect of acquiring holding and utilizing btc basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy btc and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders mstr ceo michael saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing btc holdings a man like that is hard to find but i cant get him off my mind highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube

mara happens to be in the best position to replicate what mstr is doing  
 they have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector  
 a forward thinking ceo so fred who has already began executing the microstrategy model  
 one of the strongest mining operations  
 fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving  
 a growing reputation of hodling btc  

so why not just buy mstr they were first they will come out on top right yes and no they are currently utilizing their btc holdings better than anyone else however the btc value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in driving it higher as shares are diluted mstr still has to pay their debts over time which is crucial because btc takes time to go up im simplifying this slightly plus their option premiums are pricey 

we are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with btc daily

to be clear i am not saying mstr is done running at all my conviction is simply that mara presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get fuck you money from irresponsible option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison 

hopefully you kept in mind what i said about btc not going down it helps understand the premise  
also its true facts no cap on god frfr btc is just going to keep rising its inevitable although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit but its a bull market so were throwing caution to the wind   


catalysts

if i can ask you to only read and consider one of these really have a deep think  on the first one the rest are bonuses

itcoin  i was a skeptic years ago now adoption is imminent bitcoin is the worlds reserve currency the biggest catalyst of all is the value of btc and the fact its being adopted by every person every business and every country the people drove the companies to invest and the companies are driving the countries to invest read it again its a rich mans world and they are going to want to ensure their wealth is secured without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways bitcoins monetary value fluctuates its usecases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation no one knows what price btc is going to but i bet my dick its much higher than k 

continued aggressive purchasing of btc the sooner the better fred theil needs to show hes committed to following the marastrategy model then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more btc and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value

investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action it is easier to access bitcoin now because you dont have to directly buy btc mstr ibit and now mara give simple cheap and liquid ways to diversify in btc as fiat currency loses some market share to bitcoin

bitcoin commonly held by public companiesgovernments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out especially for public companies where cash holdings are scrutinized do you really believe undiversified cash reserves are going to remain competitive chew on this btc has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen mstr has been outperforming a majority of companies less than a year ago it was valued at less than b now its valued x higher at nearly b they have b in btc alone this isnt some small cap ssq run up its leveraged to the tits  but its achieving incredible value

infinite money glitch  btc goes up which means maras holdings go up profits per coin from mining goes up stock goes up allows them to buy more btc btc goes up  mara has the perfect supporting business for this they are literally printing money money money must be funny

there is a critical mass where companies and countries all start jumping in buying btc and that causes btc to go fucking parabolic and mara to go marabolic  its about to be a goddamn gold rush and picks  are on sale

small positives but worth noting  
 mining stocks are finally catching up to btc giving some extra momentum and volume  
 china does the most mining in the world and its courts just confirmed btc is property and therefore is now legal for cities to own  
 with all crypto rising mara can also mine other coins if it makes sense they have pivoted before to coins providing better financial value  
 saylor just tweeted mara is a company on the bitcoin standard we have daddys approval   
 

numbers

i had break my  no math on weekends rule to write this aint it sad

i am only going to go over mara compared to mstr they have the most bitcoins and mstr is maras biggest competitor numbers are from nov st assume a btc value of k premium calculations are taken from ujazzlikerecord on reddit they obviously fluctuate daily but i am just using them to illustrate a point

while the value of mstr is derived  from its btc holdings essentially making it just a proxy mara has an operational business valued at b so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per bitcoin

holdings value bitcoin  
 mara b  mstr b  
   
gross equity operating company value  
 mara b  mstr b  
   
net equity after debt  
 mara b  mstr b  
   
market cap  
 mara b  mstr b  
   
premium per share  
 mara x  mstr x  
   
implied price per btc  
 mara k  mstr k

 k vs k per btc

ahaaaaahh do you like paying a x higher premium i mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy fred over at marathon digital holdings hes putting his business to work

last report states mara mined  btc in oct thats   a day and k btc a year if they didnt purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow  from mining alone 

value wise there is no doubt mara  mstr  


technical analysis

the charts look fucking glorious full on ish every chart in the market is pointing to btc rising i only know how to do bargain bin ta for short term moves check this guy out for the yearly picture hes a freaking  at calling movement before it happens  
  
in his latest mara analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level  toward  and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run  only  mins long and very thorough  


conclusion

mara so hot right now 

my apologies if the dd was a bit cooked between the twisted teas and my self diagnosed adhd shit took a lot more time than i expected but it was worth it if you want a better dd look at the mstr ones and apply the thesis same same also i hand wrote this myself no chatgpt the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin comment eh   


how to play  buy hold repeat

in my dreams i have a plan my conviction is that mara hits at least  in  but im not stopping there  
you can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the premarket i think bh is better

plays ordered by highest profit potential  
 buy options now make the maximum on degenerate bets rinse repeat reinvest  x your portfolio  
 wait until mara starts deviating more from mstr and other mining companies buy stock   month out options and keep rolling profits into shares  
 buy stock now take  out every time it doubles      
 wait until its too late  


life is short lets make enough money now so we can spend the rest of it on our terms i wouldnt have to work at all id fool around and have a ball","['\nuser report   \n\ntotal submissions    first
